1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,919
 All right everybody, happy Tuesday.

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,440
 At least I'm very happy today because we've been trending all day on X,

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,480
 given the interview that I gave with Rabbi Barclay yesterday.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,679
 A lot of you guys have so many comments regarding that back and forth.

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:17,640
 And one of the questions that I have is why so

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,640
 many people think I'm going to get killed?

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,039
 Yeah, it's a recurring theme.

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,000
 People are like be careful Candace, double up on your security.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,320
 Don't do this, don't do that.

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,600
 They're going to kill you.

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,640
 You're going to get Michael Jackson.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,400
 Where is all of that rhetoric coming from?

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,920
 Today I want to unpack it and I want to formally state my history when it comes

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,439
 to my engagement with the political movement in America.

15
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,320
 Reveal to you guys some things that I've never revealed before.

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,120
 Really want to crack open this dialogue.

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,719
 All that and more today coming up on Candace Owens.

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:01:03,200
 All right guys, a tremendous, tremendous response.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,480
 Honestly, thank you.

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,759
 I think people of all races and religions were just shocked by the conversation that

21
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,519
 I had with Rabbi Barclay yesterday.

22
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,120
 It wasn't really much of a conversation.

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,519
 Obviously, he spoke a lot more than I did.

24
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,640
 But I was happy for that.

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,000
 I was grateful for that because I wanted people to hear his perspectives.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,920
 I know this is going to sound weird, but I kind of like Rabbi Barclay because I think

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,000
 he's honest.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,200
 I think he honestly, as I tweeted yesterday, views himself as better and more important

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,960
 or at least his race as more important than other races, more significant the history

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,120
 of his race as more significant.

31
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,480
 And even in terms of someone being a supremacist, if you are honestly a supremacist, at least

32
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,359
 I can appreciate that because you're not hiding who you are.

33
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:49,799
 And that's why I meant it when I said that he will always be welcomed back onto this

34
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,799
 show.

35
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,799
 I think it takes courage to have conversations.

36
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,799
 And I think that what he did yesterday was actually quite courageous.

37
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,120
 A couple of moments that you guys were shocked by, just like me, was I guess just the lack

38
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,760
 of definition when it comes to anti-Semitism.

39
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
 It mutates.

40
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,280
 He told us that over and over again.

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
 It is a definition.

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,039
 It is a hate that mutates, which essentially, at least the way I took it, and I think most

43
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:19,039
 of you took it means that it can just be whatever they say that it is, including the term hag.

44
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,039
 I think I actually learned the word hag from watching the movie Hocus Pocus when I was

45
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,039
 a kid.

46
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,560
 It actually was one of my favorite movies.

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,319
 And they used the word hag, and I used it to describe someone that is engaging in which

48
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,759
 like behavior, trying to cast a spell on audiences to convince them that can is owned as an anti-Semite

49
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,199
 when I could not be further from that sort of a category.

50
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,919
 I am just, I have no hatred towards Jewish people in my soul.

51
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,919
 I just don't.

52
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:45,199
 I had many experiences with Jewish people growing up.

53
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,199
 I've already recounted those.

54
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,759
 We're not going to do that today.

55
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,799
 But yes, Rabbi Barclay says that the scholars agree.

56
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:52,679
 He kept talking down to me.

57
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:53,679
 It's the scholars.

58
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:54,679
 It's the intelligentsia.

59
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:58,919
 They're so much smarter than us, and they understand the definition just changes.

60
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,079
 I think a lot of you guys were also surprised by the double down, right, in the face of

61
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:04,079
 overwhelming evidence.

62
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:09,319
 I just thought there was no way, once we pulled the clips of me saying the exact opposite of

63
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,319
 what he claimed that I said.

64
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,680
 I thought there was no way that he was going to double down it, but he did.

65
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,319
 He particularly doubled down on the Hitler is okay, Candace thing, right?

66
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,759
 Candace said Hitler is okay.

67
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,280
 He repeated that over and over again in that hit piece.

68
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,199
 And then I show that I did not in any way say Hitler was okay because what crazy person

69
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,199
 would ever jump on a stage and say that.

70
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,439
 Here's one comment from YouTube.

71
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:41,719
 He wrote, when she played her Hitler quote and he still stood by what he wrote, I lost

72
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,199
 respect for this guy.

73
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,199
 Yeah.

74
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,560
 A lot of comments looked like that.

75
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,960
 And I think especially because so many people had never actually heard what I said in its

76
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
 entirety.

77
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
 You've seen the libels.

78
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
 You've seen the smears.

79
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
 They've been printed for years.

80
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,520
 I am still having to clarify.

81
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,439
 For years I have been clarifying what I said.

82
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,759
 And many of you guys have never heard it because you've just seen article after article hit

83
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,560
 after hit people trying to convince the masses that I said something that I simply never

84
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,759
 said.

85
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,280
 And in watching that clip, I think people were shocked.

86
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,240
 But yes, this is the truth.

87
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,719
 And factually speaking, as a political pundit, whatever it is that you want to call me as

88
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:24,480
 a podcaster, I have been smeared and libeled for years.

89
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,480
 And I feel a power building in that people are getting tired of this.

90
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,159
 We are being tired of being propagandized.

91
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,720
 And that is why for me, I feel in my soul at the time is now.

92
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,880
 And people are asking why is Canada speaking out right now?

93
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,920
 Well, the truth is, is I'm simply tired of being lied on.

94
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
 I'm a human, right?

95
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,760
 Eventually you get to a point where you say I'm just not going to allow people to lie

96
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,920
 on my name anymore.

97
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,080
 Especially again, as I said, when it's been happening for years.

98
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,080
 And really all I've ever done since I've had a platform is just tried to show you guys

99
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
 the truth.

100
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,599
 I don't want to tell you what to think.

101
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:07,159
 I can only share with you what my experiences are and hope that it helps you develop your

102
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:08,659
 own ideas.

103
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:11,599
 So let's recap, because I'm going to share some things I've never shared before.

104
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:15,479
 Obviously, you guys know that I hit the scene in 2017.

105
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,519
 And I had a laser sharp focus on the black community.

106
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,199
 My career began when I started making YouTube videos, really challenging the BLM narrative.

107
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:29,039
 I was having my own awakening in real time about the lies that the media was printing

108
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,280
 about black people, really lies that were meant in my viewpoint to keep black people

109
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,080
 down, to encourage black people to live a life of criminality, to encourage black people

110
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,680
 to loot and to riot their own neighborhoods in the name of some perceived social justice.

111
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,680
 I pretty immediately got hired at Turning Point USA.

112
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,000
 I hit the ground running with Charlie Kirk.

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,040
 Charlie Kirk is unapologetically pro-Israel.

114
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,400
 Everybody knows this.

115
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,519
 I was beside him throughout most of his pro-Israel commentary.

116
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:02,959
 And I bet if people dug it up on the internet, you would hear me saying pro-Israel talking

117
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,959
 points.

118
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,839
 And I say talking points because when I got into it, I didn't really care again about

119
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,359
 Israel because I was an American.

120
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:11,000
 And I just want to talk about black America.

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,519
 But certainly, I was nodding my head no matter what Charlie Kirk said, because I was just

122
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,719
 grateful to have a platform to talk about the things that were important to me.

123
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:22,239
 And I had a wonderful experience with Charlie Kirk.

124
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,759
 And I learned a lot under him and with Turning Point USA.

125
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:32,040
 In 2018, Charlie Kirk and I traveled to the United Kingdom.

126
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:39,800
 And it is there that I gave a notorious speech in November of 2018 where that clip was derived

127
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
 from.

128
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,199
 I'm going to show you that clip again in its context.

129
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,040
 We were talking about things that were happening in the United States.

130
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,560
 And somebody raised their hand and asked about the word nationalism, why we're also afraid

131
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,600
 to say I'm a nationalist.

132
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,959
 I am focused on my own nation.

133
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:02,680
 And in trying to answer their question, I basically said because the word nationalism

134
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,079
 has been wrongly attributed to Adolf Hitler, at least in America.

135
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,800
 And that's why people are afraid to embrace the word.

136
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,879
 Here are my words again.

137
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,379
 I agree.

138
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,439
 I actually don't have any problems at all with the word nationalism.

139
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:23,439
 I think that the definition gets poisoned by a leader that actually wants globalism.

140
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,920
 Globalism is what I don't want.

141
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,240
 So whenever we say nationalism, the first thing people think about, at least in America,

142
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
 is Hitler.

143
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,079
 He was a national socialist.

144
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,319
 But if Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, okay, fine.

145
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,240
 The problem is that he had dreams outside of Germany.

146
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,439
 He wanted to globalize.

147
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,079
 He wanted everybody to be German, everybody to be speaking German, everybody to look a

148
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,279
 different way.

149
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,959
 That's not to me, that's not nationalism.

150
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:52,959
 So in thinking about how we could go bad down the line, I don't really have an issue with

151
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,959
 nationalism.

152
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,959
 I really don't.

153
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,959
 I think that it's okay.

154
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:00,399
 It's important to retain your country's identity and to make sure that what's happening

155
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,319
 here, which I think is incredibly worse in terms of just the decrease in the birth rate

156
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,519
 that we're seeing in the UK, is what you kind of want to avoid.

157
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,919
 So I don't have anything problem.

158
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,239
 I have no problems with nationalism.

159
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:14,759
 It's globalism that I try to avoid.

160
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,680
 Where you have it, I have no issues with nationalism.

161
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,199
 There's no person that can watch that clip and somehow believe that I was saying it's

162
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,039
 totally okay to holocaust the Jews.

163
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:25,480
 I didn't even mention the word holocaust.

164
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,959
 I didn't mention the word Jews.

165
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,680
 Truly was answering a question about whether or not we should embrace the word nationalism,

166
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,679
 but that didn't matter.

167
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,960
 Now, again, I want to be clear that that clip that you're watching, that was recorded in

168
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,360
 2018 at a live event in the UK.

169
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,879
 And there were journalists at that event.

170
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,679
 I was interviewed by journalists at that event.

171
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:47,240
 About 200 people were in attendance amongst them.

172
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,759
 Many Jewish people were in attendance.

173
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,759
 Nobody cared.

174
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:52,279
 Nobody thought it was problematic what I said on stage.

175
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:59,759
 Fast forward to 2019 and out of nowhere, a journalist writing for Media Matters decided

176
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,480
 to make that clip go viral online.

177
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,120
 The journalist's name who made that clip go viral on Twitter was Jonathan Whitehouse.

178
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,840
 Again, he writes for Media Matters and suddenly I woke up months after having given a speech

179
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:19,720
 to every person calling for me to be canceled because I supported Adolf Hitler.

180
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
 That's not a joke.

181
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,920
 I'm showing you some headlines.

182
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,920
 This Media Matters turning point USA's Candace Owens quote, if Hitler just wanted to make

183
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,720
 Germany great and have things run well, okay, fine.

184
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,399
 I have no problem with nationalism.

185
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,040
 Wow, that's kind of making it seem very different from what I was actually saying.

186
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,519
 Behind them Buzzfeed news, Candace Owens, if Hitler just wanted to make Germany great

187
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,600
 and have things run well, okay, fine.

188
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,240
 Again, no context giving stop quotations.

189
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,759
 You can imagine the firestorm that was caused.

190
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,920
 And Mediaite Candace Owens, Hitler's nationalism was actually fine.

191
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,759
 It was his globalism that was a problem.

192
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:58,120
 You can already see what they were trying to do.

193
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,560
 And again, the firestorm that I endured, I will tell you something personal.

194
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:08,920
 I was so stressed out by that event that I stressed myself into an autoimmune response.

195
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:11,559
 My body was breaking down because I didn't understand what was happening.

196
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:15,559
 I had never in my entire life been accused of anti-Semitism and suddenly I was fighting

197
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,639
 for my career.

198
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:22,639
 I was temporarily blacklisted from Fox News for having said this sentence, which suddenly

199
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,319
 again was pulled out of obscurity.

200
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:30,279
 And I quite literally was facing a threat that everything was going to be over because

201
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,279
 how dare I say that?

202
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,360
 I have absolutely no right to say that.

203
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,120
 And then you had Jewish organizations that issued very strong statements against them,

204
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,279
 among them the Simon Wiesenthal Center.

205
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:47,480
 Here is a tweet from them when this was going viral back in February 18, sorry, back on

206
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:54,320
 February 8, 2019, they wrote, scope and depth of Candace Owens's lack of knowledge of basic

207
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,200
 history is appalling and frightening.

208
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,879
 Hitler's program to make Germany great was based on race and anti-Semitism.

209
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,200
 Also of course, the ADL instantly jumped on this.

210
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,960
 They tweeted, they retweeted first and foremost John Whitehouse, so they helped to make this

211
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,519
 video go viral.

212
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:18,080
 And then they wrote this in response, Candace Owens bizarrely claims, Hitler went wrong

213
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,279
 only when he meddled in other countries.

214
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,960
 Hitler's murderous crimes against Jews and others were horrific, regardless of whether

215
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,679
 they occurred across Europe or in Germany alone.

216
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,799
 Hitler wasn't a globalist, but a genocidal dictator.

217
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,279
 So you see what they're doing here.

218
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,679
 They're just engaging in the libel and the slander.

219
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,959
 They're trying to color people's opinions before they've actually heard or understood

220
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,839
 the context of what I was saying.

221
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,360
 And let me tell you guys something.

222
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,839
 It worked.

223
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,799
 It actually worked.

224
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,039
 That is the power of the media.

225
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,720
 I felt like it was a hit job.

226
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,360
 Like someone just said, we've got to get her, pour through every second of footage of Candace

227
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
 Owens speaking.

228
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,679
 We're going to pull something out of context and this girl is going to be gone because

229
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,360
 what else could this be?

230
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:05,000
 Of course, if I was on stage saying I love Hitler, it would have gotten viral back in

231
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 November.

232
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,399
 The Jewish people that attended my speech would have been outraged immediately.

233
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,279
 Why was this suddenly popping up in February of 2019?

234
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,159
 I'll never have an answer on that, but something that I never shared and I want to share today

235
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,680
 was what happened thereafter.

236
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,159
 A friend of mine who I am not going to name encouraged me to visit the Simon Wiesenthal

237
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,159
 Center.

238
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,720
 That's a human rights organization.

239
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:34,680
 There was this very strange meeting that occurred.

240
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:40,560
 I want to be clear that I didn't understand the meeting because the individuals were speaking

241
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,639
 in Hebrew.

242
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,200
 My understanding going into it was that once I spoke to this individual, things would be

243
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:53,240
 clarified and then I could just go on living and my reputation would pretty much be restored.

244
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,879
 And by golly, that's kind of what happened.

245
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:58,559
 So again, it was an extremely old man.

246
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,759
 I think he runs the place.

247
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:00,759
 I don't know.

248
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,720
 I can't remember his name, so I'm not going to make one up.

249
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:10,240
 But I had to sit in the meeting and explain that I didn't think Hitler was a great person,

250
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,600
 listen to two people speak Hebrew, and my reputation was restored.

251
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,759
 Or at least I was allowed to go on pursuing what I wanted to pursue, which was just talking

252
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:22,720
 about black Americans and the fracturing of the black and white relationship.

253
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,440
 It's a very odd thing when I reflect on that.

254
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:32,320
 But I want to be clear that the threats, the threats that can't just be over at any moment

255
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,120
 for you, don't you get out of line again by saying something that you never actually

256
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,360
 said, but don't make us have to threaten you again.

257
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,200
 That I still always felt over me because it was just a very scary thing to go through.

258
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,639
 We spend way too much time on our phones, which is bad enough as it is.

259
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:52,279
 Perhaps even worse is that your phone carrier can track everything you're doing on your

260
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,159
 phone, which is a gross invasion of privacy.

261
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,720
 Many companies have even admitted to it.

262
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,000
 They say it so they can, quote, unquote, better understand your interests.

263
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,399
 But really, what they want is to sell your activity to advertisers, stuff like the sites

264
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,879
 you visited and what you've been up to online.

265
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,360
 More they can get on you of a larger their paycheck, which is why I use ExpressVPN.

266
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,079
 It takes the top of a button and your network data is encrypted and rerouted through ExpressVPN's

267
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,919
 secure servers for ultimate privacy.

268
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:20,559
 ExpressVPN shields your web browsing and protects all of your network data so you can

269
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,000
 stay private even when you're using your favorite apps.

270
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,519
 Whether you're an iPhone, Android, or tablet user, ExpressVPN works on all of your devices.

271
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,799
 The best part is that one subscription can be used on up to five devices at the same time.

272
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:36,279
 Visit expressdpn.com slash canvas to get the same VPN that I use.

273
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:44,879
 Use my link to get three extra months free at expresvpn.com slash canvas.

274
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:52,000
 But let's fast forward now to 2022 to a situation that the entire world was made aware of, obviously.

275
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,799
 When Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, tweeted this.

276
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:02,399
 He tweeted, I'm a bit sleepy tonight, but when I wake up, I'm going, death con three on Jewish people.

277
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,039
 The funny thing is I actually can't be anti-Semitic because black people are actually Jew.

278
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:14,159
 Also, you guys have toyed with me and tried to blackball anyone who ever opposes your agenda.

279
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,439
 It's good to look at his tweet now without it being interpreted in the media, especially at Lawson.

280
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:23,759
 You guys have toyed with me and tried to blackball anyone who ever opposes your agenda.

281
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,360
 Now at that time, obviously, the reason why people were looking for me to make a statement

282
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:35,000
 is that this tweet came very close to the time that I had taken the notorious picture with Kanye West.

283
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,319
 We both wore white lives matter t-shirts at his fashion show in Paris.

284
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:44,039
 Again, me teaming up with Kanye because I have a laser focus on the black community.

285
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:51,159
 I had a laser focus on wanting to destroy black lives matter as an organization because I knew that they were lying to the black community.

286
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:57,399
 Again, my entire relationship and what I did publicly with Kanye was based on black America.

287
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,279
 Again, because this tweet came closely thereafter, people were looking at me to comment.

288
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,120
 The truth is that I was aware behind the scenes.

289
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,360
 Kanye gave me conversations.

290
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:16,240
 I read them in their entirety of very specific Jewish people who I would say were definitively making threats against him.

291
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,720
 And so I had more knowledge than the public had when he shared this tweet.

292
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,759
 Now, what happened thereafter was I tried to caution the public the very next day following his tweet.

293
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,000
 So he had done nothing else yet.

294
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 He had done no interviews.

295
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,279
 It was just the tweet that existed in the public sphere.

296
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,959
 And I was trying to essentially say to people, hold your horses because I think that once he explains what's happening behind the scenes,

297
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:45,199
 you will realize that he's not talking about all Jewish people in the entire world.

298
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,879
 He is feeling passionately about certain people that he works with.

299
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:56,120
 And here is what I said in an attempt to get people to hold their horses.

300
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
 Take a listen.

301
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,519
 That was the tweets.

302
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,519
 And people subsequently demanded that the tweet be taken down for anti-Semitism.

303
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:10,400
 Now, if you are an honest person, you did not think this tweet was anti-Semitic.

304
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,879
 You did not think that he wrote this tweet because he hates or wants to genocide Jewish people.

305
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:17,359
 This does not represent the beginning of the Holocaust.

306
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,920
 That's if you're an honest person, you'll admit that.

307
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,160
 You will admit that.

308
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,559
 Right?

309
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:26,960
 If you're an honest person, when you read this tweet, you had no idea what the hell he was talking about.

310
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:32,480
 I had no idea when I read this tweet what the hell he was talking about.

311
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,680
 This tweet inspired questions, not answers.

312
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,799
 First and foremost, what is death con three?

313
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:45,039
 Did he mean death con three, which would be a military defense position, not an offense

314
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,079
 for those of you that are offended, a military defense position?

315
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,400
 Is he tweeting this because he's reading the Newsweek headline, calling him an anti-Semitic?

316
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,000
 Is he angry because he can't believe that he's not free to talk about people in his

317
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,880
 life who happen to be Jewish without being accused of anti-Semitism?

318
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,920
 Is he saying, I'm not going to shut up and I'm going to keep tweeting and I'm going to

319
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,440
 keep calling these people out, referring to his friends that he feels slighted by?

320
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,960
 Is he talking about Jared Kushner and Josh Kushner?

321
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,480
 If you're a liar, you'll say, I know I was scared, Candace.

322
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,240
 I actually thought that Kanye West was going to launch a military strike in Israel because

323
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,279
 that's the reaction, like when I woke up and I looked at the headlines, a reaction was

324
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:32,480
 like Kanye West had gotten together a military strike and it was going to go forward in the

325
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,799
 morning time in Israel.

326
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:39,400
 That was the reaction that was met with this tweet.

327
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,519
 So that's what I said.

328
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:45,519
 And now that we're looking at it and examining it in the retrospect, you can see that I'm

329
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:52,000
 trying to suggest to people that there are specific people and he is having a reaction.

330
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,240
 And I will admit, if I fumbled the ball here and I can understand why people were upset

331
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:03,279
 about it, they read that as no, she's fully defending him and he actually does want to

332
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:05,920
 go death con three on all Jewish people everywhere.

333
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,880
 People were very upset that I had said that.

334
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,440
 But I want to be clear that I had actually read the messages that were being sent to

335
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
 him.

336
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,839
 One of them, he ended up sharing publicly, this was a text message from Harley-Pastronik

337
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:20,839
 to Kanye.

338
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:24,799
 And this was something again that I had read before he had sent that tweet.

339
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,279
 Text message reads, I'm going to help you one of a couple of ways.

340
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:33,039
 First, you and I sit down and have a loving and open conversation, but you don't use cuss

341
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,799
 words and everything that is discussed is based in fact and not some crazy stuff that

342
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,079
 dumb friend of yours told you or you saw on a tweet.

343
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,480
 Second option, I have you institutionalized again, where they medicate the crap out of

344
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,799
 you and you go back to Zomie Land forever.

345
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,639
 The play date with the kids just won't be the same.

346
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:52,639
 Is that a normal tweet?

347
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:57,079
 I will ask you guys a normal text message, pardon, or somebody in your life and Harley-Pastronik,

348
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,839
 yes, he is Jewish, to send to you.

349
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,839
 He's supposed to be a trainer.

350
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,240
 What do you mean I'll have you institutionalized again?

351
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
 What does that mean?

352
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,519
 Your play dates with the kid, you're threatening somebody's relationship with their kids, right?

353
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,440
 Now when you do something like that, it can drive somebody crazy.

354
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,240
 And again, I will own it if it read to people at that time that when I was saying that,

355
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:28,200
 I was defending his right to impose upon every single Jewish person in the world, I apologize.

356
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,519
 And I'm hoping that this clarifies for you what I knew, the information that I had, and

357
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:39,160
 my understanding that he was responding to threats that he was actually getting from

358
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
 specific people.

359
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:44,440
 And I was hopeful that he would talk about that in a larger capacity, but then quite

360
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:50,000
 surprised when even when he did share that tweet, there was a minimal media response

361
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 to it.

362
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,519
 It was sort of like, oh well, Harley-Pastronik is allowed to say that.

363
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,320
 And shame on you, Candace, for not recognizing it, but I want to be clear, that is the extent

364
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,320
 what you just saw of my commentary on that situation that led to a huge reaction, calls

365
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,600
 for me to resign, calls for me to get fired for defending Kanye West.

366
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:14,679
 I want to be honest here and tell you that I was also made to endure a very severe financial

367
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:19,159
 consequence behind the scenes because of those words that you heard right there.

368
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:21,439
 And one day I will talk more about that.

369
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:22,759
 You have my word.

370
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:26,119
 Let's fast forward instead to 2023.

371
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:32,240
 I'm scrolling through Twitter and a journalist, and again, this is just a few weeks after

372
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
 October 7th.

373
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,240
 And a journalist named Yashar Ali is, I think, being pretty measured in his responses.

374
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,880
 I think he's pro-Israel based on how he tweets and what he tweets about.

375
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:50,599
 But on this day, he was focused on something that Brian Mast, a congressman, had said on

376
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,599
 the floor.

377
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,799
 Yashar Ali tweeted, this is absolutely sick stuff from Rep.

378
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,799
 Brian Mast.

379
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:00,120
 And if there's any decency left in Congress, a resolution will be passed to condemn his

380
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,680
 remarks and he'll be removed from the Foreign Affairs Committee.

381
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,759
 I'm not naive enough to think he'd resign.

382
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:10,279
 So I saw this tweet and then I clicked to see what Brian Mast said and I was equally

383
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,440
 as disgusted.

384
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,599
 Here is what Brian Mast said.

385
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:19,839
 As a whole, I would encourage the other side to not so lightly throw around the idea of

386
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,599
 innocent Palestinian civilians, as is frequently said.

387
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:31,039
 I don't think we would so lightly throw around the term innocent Nazi civilians during World

388
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,160
 War II.

389
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,560
 I hope that enrages you because what he's basically saying is there's no such thing

390
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,920
 as an innocent Palestinian life.

391
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,400
 And basically, I believe, was laying the groundwork for genocide.

392
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,040
 That's genocidal language to say about any group of people.

393
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,160
 If I say there's no such thing as an innocent Iraqi, it doesn't matter who you're talking

394
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,880
 about, that is genocidal language.

395
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,200
 And so I retweeted this and I said, yeah, this was disgusting, utterly dehumanizing.

396
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,160
 Of course there are innocent civilians on either side of every conflict and we should

397
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,400
 not forget that.

398
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,000
 This is shameful, inhumane rhetoric.

399
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,840
 I shortly followed up that retweet with a blanket statement, no government anywhere

400
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,880
 has a right to commit a genocide ever.

401
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,759
 There was no justification for a genocide.

402
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:19,519
 I can't believe this even needs to be said or is even considered the least bit controversial

403
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,519
 to state.

404
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:23,840
 Of course, what Brian Mast said was wrong.

405
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,440
 When I tweeted that second tweet, people thought that I was talking about Israel or some people

406
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
 thought I was talking about Israel.

407
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,799
 They were so far in the trenches.

408
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,160
 They thought when I was making a statement that Israel is committing a genocide.

409
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,960
 But in reality, I was saying that people like Brian Mast need to cool it with their language.

410
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,080
 I get something bad has happened, but you can't say stuff like this ever.

411
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,080
 And so what happened was people who were formerly friends of mine, like Dave Rubin, began reading

412
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:53,080
 into it, began doing shows, just pretending, straight up pretending that I made a statement

413
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,720
 about the Israeli government when in fact I hadn't.

414
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,600
 I just showed you the proof that I had not.

415
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,720
 I liked your Shars tweet.

416
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
 I retweeted it.

417
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,920
 I was obviously speaking about Brian Mast, but it didn't matter because what I learned

418
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,240
 and what I think a lot of people are learning and especially on the heels of my discussion

419
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:17,120
 with Rabbi Barclay is that even if what you said was something else, how some people feel

420
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
 should be prioritized.

421
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,839
 So even though I was talking about Brian Mast and I was proven right in talking about Brian

422
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:23,960
 Mast, I was still at fault.

423
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,720
 I needed to understand that I was still wrong because of how other people felt that the

424
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,640
 timing of my tweet wasn't right.

425
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,000
 It wasn't the right time to say that genocide was always wrong.

426
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,400
 There's a time and a place for that and that was not it.

427
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,480
 And I got even weirder because people started just spinning conspiracy theories.

428
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,440
 They started saying that I was coordinating with Tucker Carlson to intentionally get fired

429
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
 from the Daily Wire.

430
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,200
 I'm not kidding.

431
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,120
 People were beginning to say, and Dave Ruhman was among these people, that it was so obvious,

432
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
 so obvious.

433
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,120
 Gosh, why else would someone say genocide is always wrong, right?

434
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,600
 That I was trying to get hired by Tucker Carlson.

435
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,480
 There must have been some coordination between us.

436
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,160
 At 40 weeks pregnant, this was my big bad plan.

437
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,920
 This was psychopathic.

438
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,920
 None of this was true.

439
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,920
 There wasn't an ounce of truth to that statement whatsoever.

440
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,120
 In fact, I refer to this as aya non.

441
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,360
 It's like Israel and non.

442
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:23,599
 It was a conspiracy theory born of absolutely nothing, but the onslaught continued.

443
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,479
 People attacking my character saying horrific things about me simply because I didn't like

444
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:29,119
 what Brian Masth has said.

445
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,559
 And of course, most notoriously, everybody remembers that a clip started circulating

446
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:38,839
 of Ben Shapiro here at Daily Wire making ad hominid attacks on me, which I chose not

447
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,799
 to respond to at that time.

448
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,799
 I didn't think it was appropriate.

449
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,079
 But that, of course, just fed more people that were attacking me.

450
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:51,480

465
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,960
 So what is the actual point of that?

466
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,880
 The attacks have not stopped.

467
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,440
 You've seen this.

468
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,960
 You saw that.

469
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,680
 In my conversation with Rabbi, he is now starting to share with everybody that I'm enraged.

470
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,519
 You have Rabbi Shmueli.

471
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:50,640
 She's deranged.

472
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,400
 She just hates you so much.

473
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,079
 Smear after smear after libel after libel after libel and it will not stop.

474
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:04,400
 Two years of consistent threats and harassment from Rabbi Shmueli and his hag daughter, and

475
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
 they have not let up.

476
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,559
 They began, by the way, they jumped into the game on the basis of that clip that I just

477
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:10,279
 showed you.

478
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:12,400
 I'm not ashamed to show you guys what I said.

479
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,040
 Because nothing was anti-Semitic.

480
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,160
 I was just trying to tell people that more was happening behind the scenes.

481
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,160
 That's it.

482
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,320
 Not make any claims or yelling or saying all Jewish people are this or that.

483
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,560
 And yet, people are saying definitively that I am a Jew hater.

484
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,840
 I'm a Jew-hating bigot.

485
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,759
 That's what Rabbi Barclay said.

486
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,759
 What is the point of this?

487
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:36,120
 I want you guys to actually ask yourself this.

488
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,040
 When people say they're going to Michael Jackson, you, what are they actually referring to?

489
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:47,599
 Well, I have a suspicion that what they mean is that all of these attacks are meant to

490
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,960
 drive me crazy, right?

491
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,319
 To drive someone crazy, to make threats to their life, to smear their reputation, to

492
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:00,440
 libel them, to make them somebody who can't even be hired or work within a certain industry

493
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,480
 because they have been so forceful in their lies and in their smears.

494
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:11,559
 Basically, then to drive that person to a point of anger so that they might tweet something

495
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:15,880
 that's angry, that they might tweet something that appears to be irrational to the public

496
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,160
 so that they can turn around and they can say, told you so.

497
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,360
 I told you, Kenneth, this was crazy.

498
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,920
 I told you she was deranged.

499
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,000
 I told you she was an anti-Semite, but what's really happening is that you have specific

500
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,599
 people that are in the Jewish community that won't stop attacking me.

501
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,720
 They won't stop attacking me.

502
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:41,480
 I think most people after years of enduring this would in fact be driven crazy.

503
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,440
 People actually just yesterday after listening to the full hour, hour and a half discussion

504
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,880
 between Remy and Rabbi Barclay said, Kenneth, I don't know how you do it.

505
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
 This would drive me crazy.

506
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
 Yeah.

507
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,880
 Add years of that.

508
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
 Years of that.

509
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,880
 Headline after, headline smear after smear and ask what sort of person would still remain

510
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
 this calm.

511
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,640
 I want to be clear.

512
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,120
 What is happening is a form of psychological terrorism.

513
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,240
 What they're doing to me is a form of psychological terrorism.

514
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,560
 They want me to snap so that I can then prove their point.

515
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,720
 Actually, my options are two.

516
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:18,480
 Either we're going to keep smearing you until you snap or you can simply comply.

517
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,000
 What is the thing that they want me to comply with?

518
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 I'm not sure.

519
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,440
 I think I've been pretty rational and I've been pretty level headed.

520
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,000
 I don't understand why they have been engaging in this sort of smearing.

521
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,200
 This is why I'm terming this merchants of smear because what they're doing here is they're

522
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,000
 constantly threatening people behind the scenes, publicly threatening people by smearing their

523
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,880
 reputations and they never, ever, ever take a break.

524
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,200
 This business just keeps going on and on and on and on.

525
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,640
 The point is again to make me submit.

526
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
 Another example of that.

527
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,640
 This is rather shocking.

528
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
 I'm kidding.

529
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,400
 Yesterday, a journalist, and I'm putting this into quotation marks, despite all of the debunking

530
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,560
 that I did in that long article, in that long interview with Rabbi Barclay, already was

531
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,960
 jumping on the next smear.

532
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,080
 His name is Isaac Schor.

533
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:16,880
 He writes for, you guessed it, Mediate as well as the New York Post.

534
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,960
 He is now publicly calling to have me fired.

535
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,920
 He's written a lot of articles, by the way.

536
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,440
 He talks to a lot of people behind the scenes telling them not to run any pieces on Candace

537
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,440
 Owens.

538
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,440
 Don't talk about Candace Owens.

539
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,440
 This guy's like, you know, doing a real hit job here.

540
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,000
 And like a total rational journalist, he tweeted, how long will the Daily Wire stand by Candace

541
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Owens?

542
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,880
 No one is asking the Daily Wire to stop Owens from peddling hatred and conspiracy theories.

543
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,640
 They're just wondering why it's choosing to subsidize such behavior.

544
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,080
 Yeah, totally a rational thing for a journalist to tweet.

545
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:55,439
 He accompanied that with an article by the same title, How Long Would the Daily Wire

546
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:57,000
 Stand by Candace Owens?

547
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Because as you've seen, I've showed you the whole history.

548
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Aren't you convinced yet?

549
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,839
 They've written so many articles.

550
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:06,079
 Psychological terrorists, they told you a thousand times in anti-Semites, so it must

551
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,079
 be true.

552
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:11,480
 And why would anyone hire and stand by a raging anti-Semite?

553
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,799
 They've said it so many times, guys.

554
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,119
 And he wasn't done.

555
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:19,559
 He wrote a second headline yesterday published on Mediate.

556
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,319
 I don't know, just enraged at the fact that I had to sit down and spoke rationally to

557
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,319
 Rabbi Barclay.

558
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,119
 I don't know what's driving this.

559
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,759
 But here's the headline, Candace Owens Endorses Wild Anti-Semitic Conspiracy Theory About

560
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:37,599
 Jews Being Drunk on Christian Blood.

561
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,919
 That is the headline, you guys.

562
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:40,559
 You've been listening to this show.

563
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:46,919
 Have you ever heard me endorse a conspiracy theory about Jews being drunk on Christian

564
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:48,480
 blood?

565
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,680
 How sick and how sinister is this getting?

566
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,960
 How utterly insane this is all getting?

567
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,880
 It's starting to feel like there's some sort of a bounty on my head and the person that

568
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,720
 can convince the public of something that is so ridiculous that I can't come back from

569
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,440
 is just going to receive a ton of money.

570
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,880
 And Isaac Shore is really competing for that because do you want to know where he got that

571
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,160
 conspiracy theory from?

572
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:20,360
 A tweet that I had liked of someone defending me when Rabbi Shmueli was smearing me.

573
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,920
 He dug up an old tweet of mine that was from February, tried to present it as if it was

574
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,920
 something new and something that was about him before our back and forth ever even broke

575
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,920
 out.

576
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:36,480
 So I liked the tweet because it clarified the right date of the tweet, saying that Rabbi

577
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,080
 Shmueli, this tweet is obviously from February 20th.

578
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,440
 What are you drunk on Christian blood?

579
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,040
 Didn't even pay attention to the last part of the tweet.

580
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:46,319
 I was just obviously liked that this person was calling out this BS smearing tactic.

581
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:52,879
 Little did I know that Isaac Shore and a team of journalists are now monitoring every single

582
00:32:52,879 --> 00:33:00,159
 like of mine on Twitter to see if they can convince the public that I am advocating for

583
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,359
 insanity.

584
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:04,359
 This is how desperate they have become.

585
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,639
 So I'll ask the question, what are we actually witnessing here?

586
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:09,720
 Do you believe Isaac Shore is a victim?

587
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:16,480
 Did you believe that he is a person who genuinely in his heart thinks that I think Jews are

588
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,279
 running around drinking Christian blood by that headline?

589
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,920
 Do you think that Rabbi Barclay is a victim?

590
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,640
 Do you honestly believe his interpretation that I was the one who owed the apology to

591
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,360
 him and the Jewish community on the basis that I just won't let them keep trying to

592
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,079
 smear me out of existence, specific people in the Jewish community?

593
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,279
 God forbid, did she defend herself against Rabbi Shmueli?

594
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:39,879
 Do you believe Rabbi Shmueli is a victim?

595
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:43,480
 When you listen to these individuals speak and the things that they are publicizing,

596
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,960
 does that register to you as true victimhood?

597
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,839
 Because what it registers to me as is power, real power hiding behind a veneer of victimhood,

598
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:58,119
 the kind of power that can take somebody out and end their entire career if that person

599
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,119
 says something that they don't like.

600
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,879
 And in this case, it's not that I'm saying things that they don't like, it's that I'm

601
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:05,440
 refusing to allow my voice to be controlled.

602
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,000
 I want to be clear to you guys.

603
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,079
 I'm going to be honest with you because everybody's noticing it.

604
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:16,440
 Every single political commentator in America, every single one of them knows this.

605
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:22,079
 That if you do not step out and say things that are radically pro-Israel or if you are

606
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,519
 too quiet on certain narratives and they want you to be radically pro-Israel, you can lose

607
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:27,519
 everything.

608
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,519
 That's truth.

609
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,519
 That is a fact.

610
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:34,360
 I'm not feeling like I need to hide from that anymore because or be afraid to say it rather,

611
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:38,039
 as a better way to say it, because I've endured this for years.

612
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,360
 I'm just at the end of my rope.

613
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,720
 I have given so much rope here and I am just done with it.

614
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,559
 Every person that you are a fan of, they know this.

615
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:49,760
 Every person that you line up to go here speak, they know this.

616
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,960
 Again, it's not even on the basis of what you say.

617
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,120
 It can sometimes be on the basis of what you don't say.

618
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,120
 That an entire mob will assemble.

619
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:02,000
 You'll write piece after piece after piece until you subjugate.

620
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,119
 If you don't subjugate, the bounty grows larger.

621
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:11,679
 Yes, there was a large bounty on my head for the crime of refusing to suddenly hate Muslims

622
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:16,280
 and to condone Muslims getting bombed following October 7th.

623
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
 Everybody can see that.

624
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:25,000
 I have said nothing controversial because genuinely I was sad when a bunch of innocent

625
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,679
 Israelis were murdered and killed in horrific acts and genuinely I am sad when a bunch of

626
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:37,319
 innocent Palestinians, and yes, they do exist, Brian Mast, are now being made to endure bombing

627
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:40,599
 and all sorts of other horrific things that we are all seeing on Twitter.

628
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,599
 That is my crime.

629
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,599
 Everybody can see that.

630
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,279
 It's ridiculous to pretend that it's anything else.

631
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:46,679
 There's no language that I have to use.

632
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:52,839
 There's nothing insane that I have said other than I would like to treat all races the same.

633
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:54,159
 I refuse to be a supremacist.

634
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:57,279
 I refuse to condone supremacy.

635
00:35:57,279 --> 00:35:58,279
 That is my crime.

636
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,240
 So what I want to do here for all of you guys that are worried and that is going to happen

637
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,800
 to me is to just provide this full accounting of everything that I have ever done and everything

638
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,600
 that I have ever said that has been deemed controversial from this mafia, right, this

639
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,960
 mafia of journalists that will not let up and leave me alone.

640
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,720
 Because that's what it is.

641
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,720
 What is it?

642
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,720
 What else could it possibly be?

643
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
 You're acting like a mafia.

644
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,040
 You are threatening me.

645
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,960
 You are taking my words out of context.

646
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,400
 You are telling people to fire me on the basis that I just won't be radical, on the basis

647
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,480
 that I won't hate on command.

648
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,800
 It's not about love, it's about hate.

649
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,880
 You want me to hate on command.

650
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,159
 I want to be clear that what these journalists are engaging in is evil.

651
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:47,320
 It is absolute evil to do this to any person.

652
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,199
 I'm not going to be driven crazy by it.

653
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:52,000
 In fact, I'm going to be driven to more clarity by it.

654
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,519
 I'm going to grow stronger from this.

655
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,840
 I'm going to be a person that is more encouraged to speak out on what is happening to me.

656
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,639
 I want the public to see what is happening to me because I think they know my heart and

657
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:07,400
 they know that what I'm actually doing is refusing hatred.

658
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,559
 Balance of nature fruits and veggies is the most convenient way to get whole food ingredients

659
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:11,559
 daily.

660
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:15,679
 Balance of nature uses an advanced cold vacuum process that encapsulates fruits and vegetables

661
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,239
 into whole food supplements without sacrificing their natural antioxidants.

662
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:23,079
 These capsules are void of additives, fillers, extracts, synthetics, pesticides, or added

663
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:24,079
 sugar.

664
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:27,119
 The only thing that's in balance of nature's fruits and veggies capsules are fruits and

665
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,119
 veggies.

666
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:31,719
 Imagine trying to eat 31 different fruits and vegetables every day.

667
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,159
 That's impossible.

668
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:36,759
 With balance of nature, getting your daily fruits and vegetables is easier than ever.

669
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:41,960
 Go to balanceofnature.com and use promo code CANDIS to get 35% off your first set of fruits

670
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,440
 and veggies and an additional $10 off every additional set that you buy.

671
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,239
 That's balanceofnature.com promo code CANDIS.

672
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:56,079
 I saw this video, by the way, further to that point of Anna Kasparian.

673
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,639
 Her and I have basically been on the opposite sides of everything throughout our entire

674
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,639
 career.

675
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:04,519
 She has said horrible things about me, but so what?

676
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:09,319
 I thought this video was interesting and I'm going to show you what she said regarding

677
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:10,319
 A-PAC.

678
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:11,799
 A-PAC is evil.

679
00:38:11,799 --> 00:38:14,879
 A-PAC is evil, evil.

680
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:17,239
 My fellow Americans, are you okay with that?

681
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:22,759
 Are you okay with a lobbying group representing the best interests of a foreign government

682
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:28,639
 telling you, you need to bust your ass every day, work your job that you likely hate, and

683
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:33,319
 have a portion of your earnings taken from you by our federal government and funneled

684
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:37,000
 to the Israeli government so they can commit atrocities in the Gaza Strip?

685
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Are you okay with that?

686
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,199
 Because I'm not okay with that and nothing gets under my skin more, okay?

687
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:48,799
 And hearing these pieces of crap, say things that make it clear that they feel entitled

688
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:53,679
 to our money, entitled, entitled.

689
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,359
 That gets under my skin more than you guys understand, okay?

690
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:03,399
 That's an impassioned response and what she's referring to there are some leaked documents

691
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:05,039
 from an A-PAC meeting.

692
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:10,039
 A-PAC, of course, alongside Big Pharma, is one of the biggest lobbying organizations in

693
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,039
 the United States.

694
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:17,119
 We are congressmen and I'm certain that that includes journalists because we have a budget

695
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,119
 like A-PAC.

696
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:22,599
 Why wouldn't you be lobbying journalists as well to essentially always fight to have

697
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:23,599
 pro-Israel narratives?

698
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,519
 And again, I want to be clear.

699
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:27,199
 I am not anti-Israel.

700
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,360
 This is what is so wild about all of this.

701
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,639
 I'm just not anti-Palestinian.

702
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:38,480
 And so I hear what she is saying and I believe that what is happening right now in this country

703
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,639
 politically is an evil.

704
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:42,639
 It is wrong.

705
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:47,159
 It is completely ridiculous to have a bunch of people that are fearful to speak and say

706
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:52,280
 rational things, rational things that they know to be true because they know they can

707
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,159
 lose everything.

708
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,840
 Because they know that a bunch of journalists will pop up like a game of whack-a-mole and

709
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,480
 try to spin things that you have said to make them much more nefarious than what you actually

710
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,079
 intended when you say them because they know that these journalists have power.

711
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:10,799
 Because they know that these journalists will not stop the onslaught.

712
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:13,000
 And eventually people are going to cave.

713
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,759
 And I can't tell you guys how wrong this is.

714
00:40:15,759 --> 00:40:21,279
 It is so wrong that every fiber of my being now wants to expose this.

715
00:40:21,279 --> 00:40:25,279
 I want to invite each and every journalist that is going to continue to engage with me

716
00:40:25,279 --> 00:40:26,519
 in this fight onto my show.

717
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:32,239
 So I, as a chore, take this as a public invite for you to come down to sit with me and to

718
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:38,839
 explain to everybody why you really believed that I think Jews drink Christian blood.

719
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:40,559
 You wrote that article because you really believed it.

720
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:41,559
 You're actually a good guy.

721
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,559
 I'm sure you are.

722
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:43,559
 I'm going to sit here quietly.

723
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:46,759
 I'm going to allow you to explain yourself why you have written so many articles about

724
00:40:46,759 --> 00:40:51,959
 me and why you believe that I have to be fired because you actually believe, as you've written

725
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:55,559
 in past articles, that people like me and Tucker Carlson were anti-Semites.

726
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:00,119
 Further to that note, further to me believing that the solution to all of this is simply

727
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:03,319
 daylight, daylight being the best of disinfectants.

728
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:08,319
 I have publicly offered to Rabbi Barclay who wants me to watch the IDF footage.

729
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:13,119
 That not only will I watch the footage, but I am challenging him to use his contacts to

730
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,599
 also get me a trip to Israel and Gaza.

731
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,239
 Allow me to be a reporter on the ground.

732
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:21,519
 People feel like they're being propagandized about the matter one way or the other.

733
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:25,359
 So why not send somebody who I think I've earned the trust of the American public?

734
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,719
 I'm not someone that will ever be bought and paid for.

735
00:41:27,759 --> 00:41:31,239
 I'm not someone that will ever say things that I know to be untrue.

736
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,279
 Why not allow me to go?

737
00:41:33,279 --> 00:41:38,799
 I'll talk to IDF, show us how to talk to Netanyahu, but I also want to speak to people that are

738
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:40,079
 impacted by this in Gaza.

739
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,119
 I want to see what's going on in Gaza.

740
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,319
 Why not allow someone like me to go there and I've offered that I will bring other journalists

741
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:50,919
 that I think are middle of the line, not one way or the other.

742
00:41:50,919 --> 00:41:56,519
 Simply reporting on the matters and similarly having to endure a bunch of threats and a bunch

743
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,639
 of smears.

744
00:41:57,639 --> 00:42:03,440
 But like my friend who's just a commentator, Dave Smith, a Jewish person who is now being

745
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,599
 told that he's a self-hating Jew because he won't get in line and I don't know, deliver

746
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,000
 the APAC talking points.

747
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,880
 People have a right to know what is going on, especially when it is so significant that

748
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,119
 you're willing to take out people for not saying the right thing.

749
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,320
 So my offer stands, anybody who wants to write an article or smear me or libel me, you are

750
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,920
 invited to this show.

751
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,039
 Hopefully they'll take up my offer.

752
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:33,680
 Hopefully in a few weeks I will be out to Israel and I will be out to Gaza and I will

753
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,880
 be able to report to you guys what it is that I actually see, but I also want to say this

754
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,640
 because it's so important.

755
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,039
 I am team God.

756
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:44,920
 I'm team God.

757
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,960
 I do not fear the media.

758
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,240
 I do not fear journalists.

759
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,720
 I do not fear APAC.

760
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,760
 I don't fear big pharma.

761
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,680
 What I actually fear is God.

762
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,360
 I think that one day we are all going to have to account for the things that we have done

763
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,840
 and the things that we have said and I want to make sure that I am not a person that is

764
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,520
 parroting lies.

765
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:11,960
 The fear of losing your job, encouraging some people to spit out lies, I don't think that

766
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,960
 works in the end.

767
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,640
 I think you've got to check your priorities.

768
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:20,200
 And so with that said, I want to thank everybody who has been on this journey with me, people

769
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,400
 that have supported me.

770
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,720
 I especially want to thank all of the Jewish people that have been in the comments saying

771
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,440
 how outraged they are.

772
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,119
 And I know that it is especially difficult for you guys right now because you are being

773
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,119
 smeared.

774
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:34,320
 I mean, I'm not going to go away.

775
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:39,440
 I'm going to use my God-given voice to talk about the things that are important for me.

776
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,240
 I'm just asking to be left alone or at least just report the truth.

777
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,240
 Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, that is all the time that we have for today.

778
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:50,959
 But don't worry because we will see you tomorrow for a brand new episode.
