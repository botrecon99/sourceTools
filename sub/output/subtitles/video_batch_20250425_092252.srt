1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,832
Sometimes in life, we face moments when it becomes undeniably

2
00:00:03,896 --> 00:00:07,192
clear that something must end. It might be a

3
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:11,016
relationship, a dream that no longer inspires us, or a chapter

4
00:00:11,048 --> 00:00:14,180
of our lives we've clung to for far too long.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,584
And yet the act of letting go, of allowing it to truly end,

6
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,580
often feels like stepping into an abyss.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,976
Why is that? Why do we hesitate, even when every fiber

8
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:29,594
of our being knows the truth? It's because

9
00:00:29,682 --> 00:00:33,710
endings are painted as failures. In the story we tell ourselves,

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,866
we're taught to persevere, to hold on, to fix what's

11
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:41,274
broken at all costs. But perhaps the greatest

12
00:00:41,322 --> 00:00:44,698
misstep is not in letting go. It's in clinging to something

13
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:48,442
that has already run its course. We fear endings

14
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,786
because they feel like losses. Yet in truth,

15
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,258
an ending is merely a transformation, a shift in the pattern of life

16
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:58,030
that a life that allows something new to emerge.

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,510
Imagine holding onto a flower that has withered.

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,362
Its petals fall away. Its fragrance fades. And yet you

19
00:01:06,386 --> 00:01:09,430
grip it tightly, unwilling to let it go.

20
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,430
Why? Because the act of releasing it means acknowledging its passing.

21
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,458
But what if letting it go also meant opening your hand

22
00:01:18,514 --> 00:01:22,070
for a seed? One that could bloom into something new?

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,786
To let it end is to acknowledge the rhythm of life,

24
00:01:25,858 --> 00:01:29,450
the cycles of beginnings and endings that have always shaped our

25
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,826
existence. Without one, the other cannot

26
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:36,330
follow. Sometimes the hardest part

27
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,990
is not the end itself, but admitting that we've outgrown something.

28
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,202
It can feel like betraying a part of ourselves. But what

29
00:01:44,226 --> 00:01:48,010
if holding on is the real betrayal? When we

30
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,850
cling to what no longer serves us, we deny ourselves

31
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,058
the opportunity to grow. Life, after all, is not

32
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:59,764
static. It's a continuous dance of change.

33
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:03,604
Endings are not failures. They are the moments when life whispers, this is

34
00:02:03,612 --> 00:02:06,960
not the path anymore. Trust me, there is more ahead.

35
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,924
I remember hearing a story about a butterfly struggling

36
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:15,220
to emerge from its cocoon. A passerby,

37
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,548
seeing its struggle, decided to help. By gently opening

38
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:21,908
the cocoon, the butterfly emerged. But its

39
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:25,170
wings were underdeveloped and it could not fly.

40
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,614
What the helper didn't realize was that the struggle was necessary

41
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:32,690
for the butterfly to grow strong enough to take flight.

42
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,050
Endings often feel like that struggle.

43
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,286
They're uncomfortable, sometimes agonizing.

44
00:02:40,398 --> 00:02:43,130
But they prepare us for what comes next.

45
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,622
Without them, we remain in a state of limbo,

46
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,810
unable to grow into the fullness of our potential.

47
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,454
When we resist an ending, we also resist the wisdom

48
00:02:54,502 --> 00:02:58,342
it offers. Each ending comes with lessons. If we are

49
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:02,310
willing to listen, it might teach us about our resilience,

50
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,590
our values. Or the truth about what. What we want from

51
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,334
life. But to hear these lessons, we must first summon

52
00:03:09,382 --> 00:03:12,726
the courage to let go. And courage doesn't

53
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:17,208
mean the absence of fear. It means acting in spite of means,

54
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:20,712
trusting that life knows what it's doing, even when we

55
00:03:20,736 --> 00:03:24,232
cannot see the bigger picture. Endings are

56
00:03:24,256 --> 00:03:27,400
sacred moments of transformation. And they ask us

57
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,648
for one thing. Faith. Faith in ourselves.

58
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:34,104
Faith in the process. And faith that letting go of what was opens the

59
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:38,120
door to what can be. Think of the trees in autumn,

60
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,960
shedding their leaves. They do not resist the

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,688
cycle. They let go, trusting that spring will bring new

62
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:49,060
growth. And so must we.

63
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,180
So when the time comes, don't be afraid to let it end.

64
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,944
Trust that in the letting go, you are not losing yourself. You are finding

65
00:03:57,992 --> 00:04:00,980
the space to grow into the next version of who you are.

66
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,624
Remember, the end is not the final act.

67
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:08,140
It's the prelude to a new beginning.

68
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,802
When something ends, it's tempting to numb the pain or run from

69
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:15,602
it entirely. It's human nature,

70
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:19,570
after all, to avoid discomfort, to shield ourselves

71
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,602
from the sharp sting of loss. But what if pain isn't the

72
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:27,874
enemy we think it is? What if, instead of resisting it,

73
00:04:27,962 --> 00:04:31,378
we allowed it to be what it is, a natural part of life's ebb

74
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:35,590
and flow, A teacher pointing us toward deeper understanding.

75
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,894
Pain, when something ends, is not there to punish us.

76
00:04:40,062 --> 00:04:43,542
It's there to remind us that we care, that we were connected,

77
00:04:43,686 --> 00:04:46,570
that something mattered enough to hurt when it was gone.

78
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,134
And yet, most of us treat pain like an intruder,

79
00:04:50,262 --> 00:04:52,770
Something to be banished as quickly as possible.

80
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,614
We fill our days with distractions, hoping that if

81
00:04:56,622 --> 00:05:00,278
we keep ourselves busy enough, the ache will

82
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:03,846
dissolve on its own. But pain doesn't

83
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:07,222
vanish when ignored. It lingers in the background, waiting to be

84
00:05:07,246 --> 00:05:09,610
felt, acknowledged, and honored.

85
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,570
Have you ever noticed how much effort goes into avoiding pain?

86
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,374
We brace ourselves against it, pretend we're fine,

87
00:05:18,422 --> 00:05:21,862
or convince ourselves that we're over it before we've even begun to

88
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:25,462
process what's happened. But pain, much like a

89
00:05:25,486 --> 00:05:28,796
storm, has its own timetable. You can't rush

90
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,412
it away or force it to disappear. What you can do

91
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:35,740
is stand in its presence, let it rain down on you, and trust that

92
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,720
the storm will eventually pass.

93
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,204
There's a story of a young boy who planted a seed

94
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:45,308
in his garden. Eager for it to grow,

95
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:48,640
he would dig it up every few days to check its progress.

96
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,720
Unsurprisingly, the seed never had a chance to sprout.

97
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,966
In the same way, when we rush through pain or try to sidestep

98
00:05:56,998 --> 00:06:00,410
it, we deny ourselves the opportunity to heal.

99
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,582
Pain is like fertile Soil for growth. And when we

100
00:06:04,606 --> 00:06:08,646
sit with it, when we allow ourselves to feel its depth, something extraordinary

101
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:12,566
begins to happen. We grow stronger. We grow

102
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,654
wiser. We grow more compassionate,

103
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:19,734
not just toward ourselves, but toward others who are also navigating

104
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:23,160
their own storms. There's a strange

105
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,340
kind of beauty in allowing pain to take its course.

106
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,312
When we stop fighting it, we find that it's not as unbearable as

107
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:34,392
we feared. Pain, when welcomed rather than resisted,

108
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:37,140
has a way of softening us, opening us up.

109
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,688
It's through these cracks that light finds its way in that

110
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:45,320
transformation begins. It's often the moments of

111
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,300
deepest hurt that reveal our greatest strength.

112
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,778
But this isn't to say that pain is easy to bear.

113
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,682
It's not. It can feel like an unrelenting weight, a constant

114
00:06:56,746 --> 00:07:01,150
reminder of what's been lost. And yet, pain is not permanent.

115
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,430
Like the tide, it rises and falls.

116
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,298
It ebbs and flows. It moves through us,

117
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:11,914
shaping us as it goes. Each wave of hurt

118
00:07:11,962 --> 00:07:15,710
carries with it the potential for healing, for growth, for renewal.

119
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,736
Think of a wound. If ignored, it festers.

120
00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:23,240
But if cared for, cleaned, bandaged, and given time,

121
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,032
it heals. The scar it leaves behind doesn't signify

122
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:30,140
weakness or failure. It tells a story of resilience.

123
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,904
And so it is with emotional pain. By allowing

124
00:07:34,952 --> 00:07:38,248
it to surface, by tending to it with patience and care,

125
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:41,294
we give ourselves the chance to heal fully.

126
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:45,202
We honor the depth of our experience, and in doing so,

127
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:48,642
we honor ourselves. Pain is not the end

128
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:52,482
of the story. It's a part of the process, a necessary

129
00:07:52,546 --> 00:07:55,550
step on the path toward healing and letting go.

130
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,538
So don't be afraid to let it hurt. Feel it fully,

131
00:07:59,634 --> 00:08:03,362
not as a burden, but as a burden, but as a reminder that you are

132
00:08:03,386 --> 00:08:06,770
alive, that you are growing, that you are growing, that you are

133
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,362
moving forward. In the willingness to embrace

134
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:14,330
pain, we find the freedom to heal and eventually

135
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,150
the strength to let it go.

136
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,458
Healing is a peculiar process, isn't it?

137
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:24,122
It doesn't follow a straight line or a logical timeline.

138
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:28,030
It's not something we can control or force into submission.

139
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,978
Healing is more like a dance, one that requires patience,

140
00:08:32,074 --> 00:08:35,510
trust, and an openness to move with the rhythm of life.

141
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,504
And yet, how often do we treat healing like a task

142
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:43,232
to be completed, something to check off a list so we

143
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:47,024
can move on to the next thing. But healing

144
00:08:47,072 --> 00:08:50,832
isn't about rushing to feel okay again. It's about allowing

145
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:54,048
ourselves the space to not be okay for a while. It's about

146
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:57,664
sitting with our wounds, listening to what they have to say, and letting

147
00:08:57,712 --> 00:09:01,392
time do its quiet, mysterious work. Like a

148
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,800
tree regrowing its bark after being stripped bare,

149
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,770
healing happens slowly, layer by layer.

150
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,450
You can't rush it, nor should you try.

151
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,998
We live in a world that prizes quick fixes.

152
00:09:15,174 --> 00:09:18,570
If something is broken, we want it repaired immediately.

153
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,890
If we're hurting, we want the pain to disappear overnight.

154
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,770
But the deepest healing doesn't come from avoidance or distraction.

155
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,430
It comes from acknowledgment, from creating space for all

156
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,190
the messy, complicated feelings that arise after something has

157
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,260
ended. Healing isn't neat or tidy. It's raw and real,

158
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,832
and it asks for our full presence. Think of a

159
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:46,352
wound on your skin. If you constantly pick at

160
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:49,620
it, trying to speed up the process, it only gets worse.

161
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,368
But if you let it breathe, if you care for it gently,

162
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:58,112
it eventually closes, leaving behind a scar as a

163
00:09:58,136 --> 00:10:01,728
testament to your resilience. Emotional wounds

164
00:10:01,744 --> 00:10:06,200
are no different. They need care and attention, not force.

165
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,740
Healing comes when we stop trying to control the process and instead

166
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,000
trust that it's unfolding exactly as it should.

167
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,680
There's a beautiful truth in the way nature heals itself.

168
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,200
When a forest burns, it seems like a disaster.

169
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,868
The child remains a stark, barren lifeless. But over

170
00:10:26,924 --> 00:10:29,520
time, new growth begins to appear.

171
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,512
Tiny shoots push through the ashes. Seeds that lay dormant awaken,

172
00:10:34,656 --> 00:10:38,256
and life returns in ways that are often richer and

173
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:39,900
more vibrant than before.

174
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,928
The forest doesn't rebuild itself overnight, but it does

175
00:10:44,984 --> 00:10:48,208
rebuild in its own time. It finds

176
00:10:48,224 --> 00:10:49,740
a way to thrive again.

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,136
And so it is with us. Healing is not about returning

178
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:58,568
to who we were before the pain. It's about becoming

179
00:10:58,664 --> 00:11:02,980
someone new, someone shaped by the experience, but not defined by it.

180
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,464
It's about learning to carry our scars with grace, to let them remind

181
00:11:07,512 --> 00:11:10,712
us not of what we lost, but of what we gained. Strength,

182
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:14,660
wisdom, and the ability to move forward with an open heart.

183
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,340
It's important to remember that healing is not linear.

184
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,098
Some days, you'll feel like you're making progress,

185
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:26,690
and other days you might feel like you're right back where you started.

186
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,062
But this, too, is part of the process. Healing is

187
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:33,610
a journey, not a destination.

188
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,406
It's a continual unfolding, a gradual letting

189
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:41,558
go of what no longer serves us so that we can make room

190
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:45,542
for what's next. We often think of healing as something we

191
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:48,710
must do alone. But it's worth remembering that

192
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,650
connection can be a powerful part of the process. Process.

193
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,022
Whether it's leaning on a friend, seeking guidance from

194
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:59,734
a mentor, or simply allowing yourself to be seen and heard,

195
00:11:59,862 --> 00:12:02,534
healing happens in the presence of compassion,

196
00:12:02,662 --> 00:12:04,810
both from others and from ourselves.

197
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,730
So let it heal. Let it take the time it needs.

198
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,838
Trust that the pain you feel now is not forever, that the cracks it

199
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:18,596
leaves behind will someday let in the light. Healing isn't

200
00:12:18,628 --> 00:12:21,876
about erasing the hurt. It's about transforming it into something

201
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:25,572
beautiful. Because when we allow ourselves to

202
00:12:25,596 --> 00:12:29,284
heal, we're not just mending what's broken. We're becoming whole

203
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:32,596
again in a way we never thought

204
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:36,680
possible. Letting go is often misunderstood.

205
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,308
People talk about it as if it's a simple, single act,

206
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:43,560
like opening your hand to release something you're holding.

207
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,590
But in truth, letting go is a process, not an event.

208
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,990
It's not about forgetting or pretending something didn't happen.

209
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,202
It's about releasing the grip of attachment. Not to the

210
00:12:56,226 --> 00:12:59,978
experience itself, but to the story we tell ourselves about

211
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:04,270
it. You see, we're storytellers by nature.

212
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,442
We weave narratives about what happened, why it happened,

213
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:11,886
what it says about us. When something ends,

214
00:13:11,918 --> 00:13:15,774
we often replay it in our minds over and over, trying to make sense of

215
00:13:15,782 --> 00:13:18,894
it, trying to rewrite the past in a way that feels

216
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:22,690
less painful. But the past is unchangeable.

217
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,170
What we can change is our relationship to it.

218
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,622
Letting go doesn't mean erasing memories or denying

219
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:34,702
emotions. It means loosening our attachment to the

220
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:38,656
way things were. It's about recognizing that clinging

221
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:41,300
to what's gone only prolongs the suffering.

222
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,456
Imagine trying to swim while holding onto a heavy

223
00:13:45,488 --> 00:13:49,104
rock. No matter how strong you are, the weight

224
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:52,400
will pull you down. The moment you let it go,

225
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,020
though, you find yourself free to float, to move, to breathe.

226
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,272
And yet, letting go isn't always easy. There's a

227
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:04,032
fear that if we release our hold, we'll lose something vital,

228
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:07,960
something that feels like it's part of who we are. But here's the

229
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,352
thing. What's meant for you will never require you to cling so tightly.

230
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,728
The connections, experiences, and opportunities

231
00:14:14,824 --> 00:14:18,376
that truly belong in your life will stay, not because you're

232
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:21,860
holding on, but because they are meant to.

233
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,904
Letting go is also an act of trust. It's trusting

234
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:30,648
that life knows what it's doing, even when we don't. It's trusting that

235
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:34,510
endings are not punishments, but transitions. Think of the

236
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,726
leaves falling from a tree in autumn. The tree doesn't

237
00:14:37,758 --> 00:14:41,342
fight to keep them. It lets them fall, knowing that

238
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:45,086
in time, new growth will come. The bare branches

239
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,970
are not a loss. They're a preparation for renewal.

240
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,270
There's freedom in letting go, a lightness that comes when we release what

241
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,806
no longer serves us. But to find that freedom,

242
00:14:55,838 --> 00:14:59,326
we must face the discomfort of the in between, the space where we've

243
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:02,800
let go of the old but haven't yet stepped into the new.

244
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,868
It can feel unsettling, even empty. But it's in this

245
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:10,388
space that transformation happens. It's where we

246
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:14,480
rediscover who we are without the weight of the past holding us back.

247
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,660
And as we let go, we must also forgive not

248
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,440
just others, but ourselves.

249
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,964
Forgiveness doesn't mean condoning what happened. It means freeing yourself

250
00:15:25,012 --> 00:15:28,380
from the burden of resentment. It's a gift you give yourself,

251
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,440
a way of cutting the cord that ties you to the pain.

252
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,660
Because holding on to anger or blame only binds you

253
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,800
tighter to what you're trying to release.

254
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,120
Letting go is ultimately an act of love.

255
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,332
Love for yourself, for your growth, for the life that's waiting for you. Beyond the

256
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:49,884
hurt, it's about creating space, not just for healing,

257
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:53,308
but for possibility. When we let go, we make

258
00:15:53,364 --> 00:15:57,382
room for something new to enter. We open the door

259
00:15:57,446 --> 00:16:01,318
to experiences, connections and opportunities we might

260
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:05,090
never have imagined while holding on to the past.

261
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,422
So let it go, not with force or resistance,

262
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:14,022
but with gentleness and grace. Trust that life has

263
00:16:14,046 --> 00:16:17,142
a way of unfolding exactly as it should, even when

264
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:20,310
we can't see the bigger picture. And as you

265
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,722
release what no longer serves you, you. You'll find yourself

266
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:27,290
lighter, freer, and ready to step forward into the next

267
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,350
chapter, unburdened and open to all that is yet to come.

268
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,710
When something ends, it's natural to feel an ache,

269
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,370
a kind of emptiness that seems to echo louder than

270
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,082
anything else. But it's in this space, this gap

271
00:16:43,146 --> 00:16:46,698
between what was and what is yet to come, that the seeds of growth

272
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:50,090
are planted. Pain has this remarkable way

273
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,258
of shaping us, of carving deeper wells within

274
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:57,130
us to hold more joy, more love, and more understanding.

275
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,110
Yet for this to happen, we must

276
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,982
allow ourselves to sit with the discomfort, to feel it fully

277
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:07,770
and let it guide us toward transformation.

278
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,454
You see, pain is not the enemy. It's a teacher,

279
00:17:12,502 --> 00:17:15,650
one that we often try to ignore or run from.

280
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,290
But avoiding pain only prolongs its lesson.

281
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,170
When we resist it, we give it power over us.

282
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:28,122
When we allow ourselves to feel it, however, we reclaim that power.

283
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:32,042
Pain, in its raw and unfiltered state, is simply

284
00:17:32,106 --> 00:17:35,882
energy. It moves through us not to punish, but to

285
00:17:35,906 --> 00:17:39,066
awaken. It reminds us of what we care

286
00:17:39,138 --> 00:17:42,490
about, what we've lost and what we've gained through the experience of

287
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:47,178
simply being alive. Think of a storm when

288
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:51,470
it comes. The winds howl, the rain pours, and it feels overwhelming.

289
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,780
But no storm lasts forever.

290
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,560
Eventually, the skies clear, and in their place, we often find

291
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,592
the air fresher the earth renewed. Our pain

292
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:07,256
works much the same way. It sweeps through us,

293
00:18:07,328 --> 00:18:10,680
demanding our attention. But if we let it move, if we let it

294
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,168
flow, it passes, leaving us clearer, stronger,

295
00:18:14,264 --> 00:18:16,780
and more aligned with our true selves.

296
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,620
Yet there's a vulnerability in letting yourself feel deeply.

297
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,080
Society tells us to be strong, to move on quickly, to distract

298
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,280
ourselves with busyness. But real strength

299
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,848
lies in allowing yourself to break open. It's in saying,

300
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:36,704
this hurts and staying with that hurt long enough to understand it.

301
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:40,740
In the breaking, something extraordinary happens. You begin to heal,

302
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,202
not by avoiding the pain, but by. But by moving

303
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:48,962
through it. Healing isn't about forgetting or

304
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:52,450
erasing the past. It's about integrating it,

305
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,510
about letting it become part of your story without letting it define you.

306
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,530
When we face our pain, we discover something unexpected,

307
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,290
a resilience we didn't know we had. And with that

308
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,522
resilience comes wisdom, the kind that

309
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:11,106
can only be earned by walking through the fire and emerging

310
00:19:11,138 --> 00:19:14,260
on the other side. There's a kind

311
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,748
of beauty in pain, as strange as that might

312
00:19:17,804 --> 00:19:21,204
sound. It strips away the superficial, the distractions

313
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:24,360
and the noise, leaving only what truly matters.

314
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,452
It forces us to confront ourselves, to ask the questions

315
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:31,600
we might otherwise avoid. Who am I without this?

316
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,428
What do I really need? What am I being called

317
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:39,512
to learn? These questions don't have easy answers,

318
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:43,040
but they open the door to a deeper understanding of ourselves

319
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,400
and the world around us. And while the

320
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,272
process of healing through pain can feel isolating, it's also one

321
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:53,500
of the most profoundly human experiences we share.

322
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,712
Everyone has felt loss, disappointment, or heartbreak in

323
00:19:57,736 --> 00:20:01,312
some form. To feel pain is to be alive, to be connected

324
00:20:01,376 --> 00:20:04,880
to the great tapestry of existence. And in

325
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,910
that connection, we find the strength to keep going and

326
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,766
let the pain move through you. Don't cling to it, but don't

327
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:16,670
rush it either. Give it space to teach you what it needs

328
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,254
to teach, and then let it flow. It's in this surrender

329
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,806
that we find freedom, not from the pain, but within

330
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:27,410
it. Because when we allow ourselves to hurt,

331
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,102
we also allow ourselves to heal, to grow and to

332
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:34,192
emerge anew. And so,

333
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:37,712
in the end, it's not the pain that defines us, but what we do with

334
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:41,104
it. Let it guide you, shape you, and remind you

335
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:44,640
of the strength that lies within. Let it teach you

336
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,464
that even in the darkest moments, you have the capacity to rise,

337
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:51,340
to realize, to heal, and to carry on.

338
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,224
There comes a moment when, after all the struggle, all the reflection

339
00:20:56,352 --> 00:21:00,190
and all the healing, we are faced with the final, inevitable act.

340
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,582
Letting gas. It's a concept that can feel simple in

341
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:06,610
theory, but is often anything but in practice.

342
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,942
Letting go asks us to release the weight we've been carrying.

343
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:14,462
The pain, the attachments, and even the stories we've told ourselves

344
00:21:14,526 --> 00:21:17,886
about who we are. It's not a sign of giving up or forgetting.

345
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:21,730
It's an act of courage, an act of trust.

346
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,896
It's stepping forward into the unknown without the baggage

347
00:21:25,928 --> 00:21:29,912
of the past holding you back. The hardest

348
00:21:29,976 --> 00:21:33,720
part of letting go is not the act itself, but the fear of what

349
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,656
comes after. We cling to what's familiar

350
00:21:37,768 --> 00:21:41,496
even when it no longer serves us, because we're

351
00:21:41,528 --> 00:21:44,260
afraid of the void that might take its place.

352
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,568
But this fear is an illusion. Letting go isn't about

353
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:52,136
creating emptiness. It's about creating space. Space for something

354
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:56,262
new, something unexpected, something better than what we can imagine

355
00:21:56,326 --> 00:22:00,182
while we're holding on so tightly. Think of the autumn

356
00:22:00,246 --> 00:22:03,478
leaves. They don't resist the wind when it comes

357
00:22:03,534 --> 00:22:06,966
to sweep them from the branches. They let go,

358
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,970
trusting that the tree will survive, that it will flourish again in spring.

359
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,654
In the same way, letting go allows us to move with the natural rhythms

360
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:19,510
of life. It aligns us with the flow of existence

361
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,250
rather than keeping us stuck in resistance.

362
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,848
And what is it we hold on to? Really often,

363
00:22:26,904 --> 00:22:30,752
it's not the person, the situation or the thing itself,

364
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,100
but the idea of what it meant to us,

365
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,088
the potential it carried, the identity it gave us,

366
00:22:37,144 --> 00:22:40,400
the comfort it provided. But when we

367
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,620
hold on to something too long, we lose sight of who we are without it.

368
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,700
We let it define us, even as it begins to weigh us down.

369
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,480
Letting go, then, is an act of reclaiming ourselves.

370
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,924
It's not always immediate, and it's rarely

371
00:22:56,972 --> 00:23:00,668
easy. Sometimes we have to let go, piece by

372
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:04,620
piece, moment by moment, until one day we realize the

373
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,724
grip has loosened and the burden is no longer ours

374
00:23:07,772 --> 00:23:11,084
to carry. Other times, it's a sudden

375
00:23:11,132 --> 00:23:14,940
release, like a dam breaking, flooding us with relief and

376
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,282
clarity all at once. Either way, the result is

377
00:23:18,306 --> 00:23:22,378
the same. Freedom. Freedom from the expectations,

378
00:23:22,474 --> 00:23:25,226
the hurt, the regret.

379
00:23:25,418 --> 00:23:29,690
Freedom to be present, to move forward and

380
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,670
to embrace life as it is, rather than as we wish it had been.

381
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,030
This isn't to say that letting go is without pain.

382
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:42,362
There will be moments of longing, moments where the past beckons, like an

383
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:45,864
old friend. But these moments are reminders

384
00:23:45,912 --> 00:23:48,820
of our humanity, not reasons to turn back.

385
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,144
They are opportunities to honour what was without

386
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:55,940
losing sight of what is and what could be.

387
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,020
Letting go is an act of love, not just for others, but for yourself.

388
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,400
It's recognizing that holding on to what no longer aligns with your

389
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,140
Growth is a form of self betrayal.

390
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,880
It's choosing to nurture your well being over clinging to

391
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,498
something that stunts it. It's saying I deserve to move

392
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:19,430
forward and allowing yourself the grace to do so.

393
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,194
And in letting go, we find that we are not left with nothing,

394
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:27,194
but with everything we need. The lessons we've learned, the strength

395
00:24:27,242 --> 00:24:30,938
we've gained, the clarity we found, they remain with us,

396
00:24:31,074 --> 00:24:35,018
shaping us into who we are meant to become. Letting go

397
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:38,150
doesn't mean losing it means making room for more.

398
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,038
So when the time comes, and you know it will,

399
00:24:43,094 --> 00:24:46,398
let it go. Not because it's easy, not because

400
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:49,970
it's painless, but because it's necessary.

401
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,382
Because holding on will only keep you tethered to a past that no

402
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:57,982
longer exists. Let go and you'll find that

403
00:24:58,006 --> 00:25:01,054
the act itself is not an end, but a beginning.

404
00:25:01,102 --> 00:25:04,894
The beginning of a life lived fully, freely and unapologetically

405
00:25:04,942 --> 00:25:05,850
in the present.

406
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,412
Some people will use a symbolism of the

407
00:25:15,436 --> 00:25:18,756
relationship of God to the universe, wherein God

408
00:25:18,788 --> 00:25:20,400
is, say, brilliant light,

409
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,100
only somehow veiled, hiding underneath all

410
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,560
these forms that you see as you look around you.

411
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,960
So far, so good. But the truth is funnier than that.

412
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,004
It is that you are looking right at the brilliant light

413
00:25:37,092 --> 00:25:41,212
now that the experience you

414
00:25:41,236 --> 00:25:44,428
are having, which you call ordinary everyday consciousness,

415
00:25:44,604 --> 00:25:48,508
pretending you're not it, that experience is

416
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:52,012
exactly the same thing as it. There's no difference at

417
00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:52,600
all.

418
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,120
And when you find that out, you laugh yourself silly.

419
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,850
That's the great discovery.

420
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:09,822
In other words, when you really start to see things and

421
00:26:09,846 --> 00:26:13,550
you look at an old paper cup and

422
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:16,490
you go into the nature of what it is to see,

423
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,878
what vision is, or what smell is, or what touch is,

424
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:24,650
you realize that that vision of the paper cup

425
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:29,340
is the brilliant light of the cosmos.

426
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,968
Nothing could be brighter. 10,000 suns couldn't

427
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:41,112
be brighter. Only they

428
00:26:41,136 --> 00:26:44,536
are hidden in the sense that all the points of the infinite

429
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:47,300
light are so tiny when you see them in the cup,

430
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,250
they don't blow your eyes out, but it is actually.

431
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:57,442
See, the source of all light is in the eye. If there

432
00:26:57,466 --> 00:27:00,430
were no eyes in this world, the sun would not be light.

433
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,898
You evoke light out of the universe.

434
00:27:07,074 --> 00:27:10,450
In the same way you, by virtue of having a soft skin,

435
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,630
evoke hardness out of wood.

436
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:16,710
Wood is only hard in relation to a soft skin.

437
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,430
It's your eardrum that evokes noise out of the air.

438
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:26,858
You, by being this organism, call into being

439
00:27:26,914 --> 00:27:30,362
the whole universe of light and color and hardness and heaviness

440
00:27:30,426 --> 00:27:33,882
and everything you see. But in

441
00:27:33,906 --> 00:27:37,626
the mythology that we've sold Ourselves on. During the end of the 19th century,

442
00:27:37,738 --> 00:27:41,242
when people discovered how big the universe was and that

443
00:27:41,266 --> 00:27:44,762
we live on a little planet in a solar system on the edge of a

444
00:27:44,786 --> 00:27:47,700
galaxy, which is a minor galaxy, everybody thought,

445
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,280
ah, we're really unimportant. After all,

446
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,920
God isn't there and doesn't love us and nature doesn't give a damn,

447
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,820
and we put ourselves down, see? But actually,

448
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,452
it's this little funny microbe, tiny thing

449
00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:08,360
crawling on this little planet that's way out somewhere

450
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,388
who has the ingenuity by nature of this

451
00:28:12,444 --> 00:28:16,162
magnificent organic structure to evoke the whole universe

452
00:28:16,306 --> 00:28:19,030
out of what would otherwise be mere quanta.

453
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,910
There's jazz going on.

454
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,842
But you see, this little, little ingenious organism

455
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:30,510
is not merely some stranger in this.

456
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,010
This little organism on this little planet is

457
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:38,658
what the whole show is growing there and

458
00:28:38,714 --> 00:28:40,550
so realizing its own presence.

459
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,640
Well, now, here's the problem.

460
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,240
If this is the state of affairs, which is so,

461
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,332
and if the. The consciousness state you are

462
00:28:57,356 --> 00:29:01,124
in at this moment is the same thing as what we might call the divine

463
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,676
state, if you do anything to make it different, it shows

464
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:06,480
you don't understand that it's so.

465
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,862
So the moment you start practicing yoga or praying or

466
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:18,850
meditating or indulging in some sort of spiritual cultivation,

467
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,130
you are getting in your own way.

468
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:29,070
The Buddha said, we suffer because we

469
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:33,670
desire. If you can give up desire, you will suffer.

470
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,674
But he didn't say that as the last word. He said that as the opening

471
00:29:38,722 --> 00:29:41,970
step of a dialogue. Because if he.

472
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,690
If you say that to someone, they're going to come back after a while and

473
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,510
say, yes, but I'm now desiring not to desire.

474
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,070
And so the Buddha will answer, well, at last you're beginning to understand the point,

475
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:01,112
because you can't give up desire.

476
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:03,660
Why would you try to do that? It's already desire.

477
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,592
So in the same way you say you ought to be unselfish or to

478
00:30:11,616 --> 00:30:14,744
give up your ego. Let go, relax. Why do you want to do

479
00:30:14,752 --> 00:30:18,420
that? Just because it's another way of beating the game, isn't it?

480
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,624
The moment you see, you hypothesize that you are different from the universe.

481
00:30:24,712 --> 00:30:26,300
You want to get one up on it.

482
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,728
But if you try to get one up on the universe and you're in competition

483
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:34,220
with it, it means you don't understand. You are it.

484
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,736
You think there's a real difference between self and other. But self,

485
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:42,736
what you call yourself and what you call other are

486
00:30:42,888 --> 00:30:45,820
mutually necessary to each other, like back and front.

487
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,232
They're really one. But just as A magnet polarizes itself in

488
00:30:51,256 --> 00:30:55,038
north and south, south, but it's all one magnet. So experience polarizes

489
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:57,930
itself as self and other, but it's all one.

490
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:02,174
So if you try to make the North Pole, get the mastery of

491
00:31:02,182 --> 00:31:05,022
it, or the South Pole, get the mastery of the North Pole, you show you

492
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:08,878
don't know what's going on. A guru or

493
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:12,382
teacher who wants to get this across to somebody because he knows it

494
00:31:12,406 --> 00:31:16,030
himself, and when you know it, you know you like others to see it

495
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:21,700
too. So what he does is he gets you into

496
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,248
being ridiculous harder and more

497
00:31:26,304 --> 00:31:27,980
assiduously than usual.

498
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,680
In other words, if you are in a contest with the universe,

499
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,140
he's going to stir up that contest until it becomes ridiculous.

500
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,208
And so he sets you such tasks as saying, now, of course,

501
00:31:41,264 --> 00:31:44,850
in order to be a true person, you must give

502
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:48,230
up yourself, be unselfish.

503
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,730
So the Lord sits, steps down out of heaven and

504
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:55,154
says, first and great commandment is, thou shalt

505
00:31:55,202 --> 00:31:59,314
love the Lord thy God. You must love me.

506
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:02,962
Well, that's a double bind. You can't love on

507
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:06,402
purpose. You can't be

508
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:10,164
sincere purposely. It's like trying not to think of a

509
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:12,120
green elephant while taking medicine.

510
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,340
But if a person really tries to do it, so you know, this is

511
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,292
where Christianity is rigged, you should be very sorry

512
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:27,680
for your sins. And though everybody knows they're not,

513
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,620
but they think they ought to be, and so they go around trying to be

514
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,080
penitent or trying to be humble,

515
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:39,966
and they know the more assiduously they practice it, the phonier and phonier

516
00:32:39,998 --> 00:32:43,342
the whole thing gets. And so

517
00:32:43,366 --> 00:32:46,862
in this way, it's what it's called the technique of

518
00:32:46,886 --> 00:32:50,878
reductio ad absurdum. If you

519
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:54,302
think you have a problem, you see, and that you're an ego and that

520
00:32:54,326 --> 00:32:58,142
you're in difficulty, the answer that the Zen master makes to you is,

521
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:01,780
show me your ego. I want to see. See this thing that has a problem.

522
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,512
When Bodhidharma, the legendary

523
00:33:07,656 --> 00:33:12,152
founder of Zen, came to China, a disciple

524
00:33:12,216 --> 00:33:15,832
came to him and said, I have no peace of mind. Please pacify

525
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:19,864
my mind. And Bodhidharma said, bring out your mind here before me, and I'll pacify

526
00:33:19,912 --> 00:33:24,056
it. Well, he said, when I look for it, I can't find it. So Bodhidharma

527
00:33:24,088 --> 00:33:25,580
said, there, it's pacified,

528
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:31,346
see, because when you look for your own mind, that is to say, your own

529
00:33:31,498 --> 00:33:35,026
particularized center of being, which is separate from everything

530
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:38,402
else, you won't be able to find it. The only way you'll know

531
00:33:38,426 --> 00:33:42,034
it isn't there is if you look for it hard enough to find out that

532
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:45,570
it isn't there. And so

533
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:48,722
everybody says, all right, know yourself, look within, find out

534
00:33:48,746 --> 00:33:52,082
who you are. Because the harder you look, you won't be able to find it.

535
00:33:52,106 --> 00:33:55,714
And in then you realize that it isn't there at all. There isn't a separate

536
00:33:55,762 --> 00:33:59,950
you. Your mind is what there is

537
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:04,946
everything. But the only way to find that out

538
00:34:05,018 --> 00:34:08,030
is to persist in the state of delusion as hard as possible.

539
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:11,870
That's one way. I don't say the only way, but it is one way.

540
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:16,050
And so almost all spiritual disciplines,

541
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,020
meditations, prayers, etc, etc,

542
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,440
our ways of persisting in folly,

543
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:27,340
doing resolutely and consistently what

544
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,440
you're doing already.

545
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,356
So if a person believes that the earth is flat, you can't

546
00:34:35,388 --> 00:34:38,892
talk him out of that. He knows it's flat. Look out of the window and

547
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:42,732
see. It's obviously it looks flat. So the only way to

548
00:34:42,756 --> 00:34:46,570
convince him that it isn't is to say, well, let's go and find the edge.

549
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:51,062
And in order to find the edge, you've got to be very careful not to

550
00:34:51,086 --> 00:34:53,330
walk in circles. You'll never find it that way.

551
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:57,238
So we got to go consistently in a straight line due west along

552
00:34:57,294 --> 00:35:00,662
the same line of latitude. And eventually, when we get back to

553
00:35:00,686 --> 00:35:04,214
where we started from, you've convinced the guy that the

554
00:35:04,222 --> 00:35:07,638
earth is round. But that's

555
00:35:07,654 --> 00:35:10,210
the. That's the only way that'll tell. That will teach him.

556
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,160
Because people can't be talked out of illusions.

557
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:22,076
It is in this sense that a person becomes, in the truest sense

558
00:35:22,108 --> 00:35:26,320
of the word, a self, an original,

559
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,400
authoritative source of life.

560
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,396
During the past few months I have been studying

561
00:35:34,428 --> 00:35:38,018
an extraordinarily interesting paper written

562
00:35:38,034 --> 00:35:41,842
by Joseph Campbell, whose name will be familiar to

563
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:44,882
many of you as the author of a

564
00:35:44,906 --> 00:35:48,226
book on mythology called the Hero with a Thousand Faces.

565
00:35:48,418 --> 00:35:52,470
Now this particular paper, the Symbol without Meaning, is an exploration

566
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,830
of an extraordinary phenomenon in the history of religions

567
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:02,232
which you might call the. Into the beginning,

568
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:06,640
the development and the dissolution of cosmologies

569
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,684
of great views of the world under religio

570
00:36:10,732 --> 00:36:14,120
philosophical auspices, which are the,

571
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,860
as it were, the languages about the universe

572
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,120
devised by various cultures.

573
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:27,760
Now he distinguishes two great phases in man's

574
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:31,878
religious history which

575
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:36,010
he equates with two styles of culture

576
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:41,462
which predate our own technological

577
00:36:41,526 --> 00:36:45,142
style of culture. And these are respectively,

578
00:36:45,206 --> 00:36:49,210
the hunting cultures and the agrarian cultures.

579
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,702
He points out that the kind of religion which is characteristic of

580
00:36:53,726 --> 00:36:57,840
a hunting culture is what now generally goes by the name of shamanism.

581
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,440
Although this particular word Is distinctive of

582
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:06,492
Mongolian styles Of so

583
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:10,284
called primitive religion. Nevertheless, the phenomenon known as shamanism.

584
00:37:10,332 --> 00:37:13,520
Is found distributed all over the planet.

585
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,084
Shamanism is characterized

586
00:37:19,132 --> 00:37:22,742
by the fact that it's a very

587
00:37:22,766 --> 00:37:26,210
individualistic type of religiousness. That is to say,

588
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:30,278
the religious experience of the shaman. Is not something which

589
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:33,478
he gets from an authoritative priesthood.

590
00:37:33,654 --> 00:37:37,210
It's not something handed down from generation to generation.

591
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,890
For which he goes to a human teacher.

592
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:47,142
The shamana is a solitary medicine

593
00:37:47,206 --> 00:37:49,690
man. Man of power.

594
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,810
Invariably has to find his experience for himself.

595
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:59,662
Usually it is by going alone into the

596
00:37:59,686 --> 00:38:01,970
dangers of the forests or jungles.

597
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,638
Or holding himself up for some days in

598
00:38:06,694 --> 00:38:09,870
his own hut. And undergoing some

599
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:13,502
kind of ordeal. Not necessarily on the

600
00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:17,312
physical level. So much as on the psychic level. Going through an adventure

601
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:20,580
in the psychic world. The world of spirits.

602
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,540
And when he comes through the ordeal,

603
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,368
he comes out an initiate of

604
00:38:28,424 --> 00:38:29,020
power.

605
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,752
The reason why one must attach so much importance.

606
00:38:34,816 --> 00:38:38,512
To the individual character of this experience. Is that it goes along with the

607
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:41,988
general style of a hunting culture. In which every

608
00:38:42,044 --> 00:38:45,412
individual man contains the

609
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:49,492
whole culture. That is to say, it's not the kind of culture in which specialized

610
00:38:49,556 --> 00:38:53,400
functions are needed. In which there is a division of labor.

611
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,852
The hunter spends much of his time on

612
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,180
his own. And he has to learn to take care of

613
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,920
himself in the forests.

614
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,120
Without any other human aid.

615
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:10,814
And although there are societies

616
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:15,342
and social groups. They are composed of men with

617
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:18,974
their women and children. Men who are equals because of

618
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,290
the type of life that they follow.

619
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,622
Now, an entirely different state of affairs arises. When we get

620
00:39:26,646 --> 00:39:30,686
a settled agrarian culture here.

621
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:33,330
Because the style of life is more complex.

622
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,560
A division of labor is required.

623
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:41,004
And you begin to get not only a separation of human beings.

624
00:39:41,052 --> 00:39:45,280
Into various castes and various functions.

625
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:49,468
But also the necessity of devising far

626
00:39:49,524 --> 00:39:52,988
more complex, complex languages and institutions.

627
00:39:53,084 --> 00:39:55,560
To provide communication between them.

628
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,068
And this always involves a very,

629
00:39:59,124 --> 00:40:02,470
very powerful socialization. Of the individual.

630
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:07,090
Spending his time more and more in a settled place. And therefore having

631
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,690
greater intercourse with other people. He has to learn to think

632
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,870
in accordance with common patterns.

633
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:17,986
Whether these patterns be based on language.

634
00:40:18,178 --> 00:40:22,670
Or on the type of work.

635
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:27,438
The geographical features of the area

636
00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:31,422
which he inhabits. Or whatever they may be. Each individual

637
00:40:31,486 --> 00:40:34,062
has to subordinate himself more and more.

638
00:40:34,246 --> 00:40:38,862
To a socially implanted

639
00:40:38,926 --> 00:40:41,758
view of life. Because only on these.

640
00:40:41,894 --> 00:40:45,530
Under these conditions. Is communication between the individuals possible.

641
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,870
And so it comes about that the style of religiousness. Which one

642
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,410
associates with an agrarian. As distinct from a hunting culture.

643
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:59,466
Is a traditional and authoritative style

644
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,762
of religion. In which the individual derives

645
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:06,430
his experience From a tradition.

646
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:12,922
Usually embodied in a priesthood And

647
00:41:13,106 --> 00:41:17,050
Campbell goes on to point out that

648
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:20,442
the first historical instances of

649
00:41:20,466 --> 00:41:23,882
the appearance of the familiar circle symbol, which is called in

650
00:41:23,906 --> 00:41:25,710
Sanskrit, the mandala,

651
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:31,070
is associated with the agrarian cultures.

652
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:37,082
No example of this kind of symbol is found archaeologically prior

653
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:41,130
to the development of

654
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,270
an agrarian community.

655
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:49,670
Now, I might say something about the mandala as a

656
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:53,802
world mythological symbol, Although anybody who studied the works of

657
00:41:53,826 --> 00:41:57,488
CG Jung is very familiar with it. A mandala

658
00:41:57,504 --> 00:42:00,624
is essentially a circle, usually divided

659
00:42:00,672 --> 00:42:04,800
into four quarters or multiples of four, and has

660
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,580
in it, as it were, the general theme of the integration

661
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,180
of a community.

662
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,792
It is not unlike, for example, a stockaded village

663
00:42:19,856 --> 00:42:23,514
or city, a ring of defense

664
00:42:23,562 --> 00:42:24,830
around the center.

665
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:31,178
And Campbell shows that the

666
00:42:31,314 --> 00:42:35,002
symbol represents the formation of the kind of society

667
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:38,922
we're talking about where the

668
00:42:38,946 --> 00:42:43,082
human functions are divided. And we find in many of these ancient societies that the

669
00:42:43,106 --> 00:42:47,410
functions are precisely divided into four for

670
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:51,042
groups. Just as in medieval European

671
00:42:51,106 --> 00:42:55,298
society, we had the spiritual power, the priesthood,

672
00:42:55,474 --> 00:42:57,670
the temporal power, the nobility,

673
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:02,194
the commons and the

674
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:05,410
serfs, so in ancient Indian society,

675
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:09,794
we had the Brahmana caste, the priesthood, the Kshatriya

676
00:43:09,842 --> 00:43:12,790
caste, the rulers and soldiers,

677
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,588
the Vaishya caste, the commons or merchants,

678
00:43:16,764 --> 00:43:19,200
and the Shudra caste, the laborers.

679
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,820
So these four castes represented, as it were,

680
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:27,500
represented by the four divisions of the mandala,

681
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:31,360
the common, integrated,

682
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,400
encircled community.

683
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:40,006
And the important point

684
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:43,382
that he makes about its religiousness is, as I said, that it was an

685
00:43:43,406 --> 00:43:46,998
experience carried down

686
00:43:47,054 --> 00:43:50,742
by tradition, an experience in

687
00:43:50,766 --> 00:43:53,990
which a priestly caste was

688
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:57,702
the authority, and which had

689
00:43:57,726 --> 00:44:01,766
to be a common experience, just because

690
00:44:01,918 --> 00:44:05,894
the whole style of life in a community of this kind depended upon

691
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:09,836
communication. And we can communicate

692
00:44:09,868 --> 00:44:14,092
with each other by virtue, not only of sharing a common language,

693
00:44:14,156 --> 00:44:18,012
but also, more importantly, by sharing a common view of

694
00:44:18,036 --> 00:44:21,500
the world. A common type of

695
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:25,020
sensuous experience is, of course, why those who

696
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:29,212
have the type of sensuous experiences which we call hallucinations

697
00:44:29,356 --> 00:44:32,280
and illusions do not fit easily into a community.

698
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:42,900
But every so often, his paper goes on to show the

699
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:46,740
social cosmologies. Views of the world held in common by

700
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,640
societies tend to break up.

701
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,740
And actually, he starts the paper in

702
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,276
the 15th century, when, through the expansion

703
00:44:58,308 --> 00:45:02,094
of the Western world, through not only exploration

704
00:45:02,142 --> 00:45:05,534
of the surface of the globe, but greater knowledge of

705
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:09,822
astronomy, begins to break up the geocentric

706
00:45:09,886 --> 00:45:14,050
view of the Ptolemaic universe,

707
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:18,610
the view of the world under which Christianity itself had come to birth.

708
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,726
And this he looks upon as a breaking

709
00:45:23,758 --> 00:45:26,130
up of the mandala,

710
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:30,290
a breaking up of the

711
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:34,594
communal, agreed, stable picture of the world

712
00:45:34,762 --> 00:45:38,242
by means of which men were able to communicate. With each other

713
00:45:38,426 --> 00:45:41,730
and a breaking up, therefore, which involves a disruption

714
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:47,186
of all our means of communication and

715
00:45:47,258 --> 00:45:50,706
a throwing of culture into

716
00:45:50,858 --> 00:45:52,710
a fundamental confusion.

717
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,800
It is perhaps, if this be true,

718
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,160
just because of the breaking up

719
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:09,740
of the unified worldview and an

720
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,404
entry into the confused world of the relativistic world of modern

721
00:46:13,452 --> 00:46:17,920
thought, that the Western peoples have become interested

722
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:22,930
in other and former attempts to deal with

723
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:27,730
life as it. As it must be lived when

724
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:30,690
the mandala, as it were, breaks up.

725
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,650
For after all, the idea of

726
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:40,550
going beyond the communal view of the world and

727
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,730
somehow managing to get along without it is not a new thing.

728
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,100
It's very interesting that in ancient Indian society,

729
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,700
and to some extent even still in modern Indian society,

730
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,592
that when a man has done his work in society

731
00:46:58,656 --> 00:47:02,180
and is able to hand over his caste duties,

732
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,160
whether they be priestly or political or professional, to his

733
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,876
son or sons, that,

734
00:47:10,008 --> 00:47:13,100
as I think you all know, he, as it were,

735
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,492
abandons the world and

736
00:47:16,676 --> 00:47:20,220
gives up caste and becomes what is ordinarily called

737
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:23,756
a sannyasin. We speak

738
00:47:23,788 --> 00:47:27,800
of that usually as holy man or hermit or

739
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,164
spiritual devotee of some kind. But what is of particular interest

740
00:47:33,252 --> 00:47:37,398
in this connection is the. The abandonment

741
00:47:37,414 --> 00:47:40,486
of caste is also called

742
00:47:40,638 --> 00:47:44,010
entering into the state of Vanaprastha.

743
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:47,930
Vanaprastha in Sanskrit means a forest dweller.

744
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:53,050
And in this sense, the man who gives up caste

745
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:58,374
goes back, as it were, to the style

746
00:47:58,422 --> 00:48:01,974
of life that predates the agrarian culture. He goes, as it

747
00:48:01,982 --> 00:48:03,770
were, back to shamanism.

748
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:08,620
And this is true not only in Indian culture, but also

749
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:12,492
in Chinese. For whereas the Confucian

750
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:17,164
way of life represents the community weltenchaum,

751
00:48:17,212 --> 00:48:20,680
that is what the mandala corresponds to,

752
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:25,052
the enclosed, nice little, tight little world in which we feel

753
00:48:25,156 --> 00:48:28,440
we understand each other and understand our environment.

754
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:34,730
In China, the Daoist philosophy

755
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:38,758
is the philosophy

756
00:48:38,854 --> 00:48:43,254
corresponding to the Indian search

757
00:48:43,302 --> 00:48:46,918
for liberation or moksha, liberation, that is to say,

758
00:48:46,974 --> 00:48:50,130
from the socially conditioned view of the world.

759
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,944
And there is evidence to show that the Taoist

760
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:59,788
solitary sage has some

761
00:48:59,844 --> 00:49:04,320
sort of ancestral connection with the shaman.

762
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,964
Of course, we should not suppose that the entry

763
00:49:10,012 --> 00:49:13,692
into the stage of Vanaprastha or the return to the forest by the Taoist

764
00:49:13,756 --> 00:49:16,480
sage is, in the strict sense of the word, a regression,

765
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,614
going back to the shaman's religion, going back to

766
00:49:21,622 --> 00:49:25,118
the life of the hunter, and at the same time going

767
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:29,694
beyond the place where we find ourselves in a society where the

768
00:49:29,782 --> 00:49:33,410
worldview is a conditioned social pattern.

769
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:38,318
Now, in what sense and in just what way is this going

770
00:49:38,374 --> 00:49:41,950
beyond? And likewise, how does it apply to our

771
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:46,370
own situation where we are not, as it were, going voluntarily beyond

772
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,460
a nice, clear,

773
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:53,352
authoritative and comfortable view of the world. But rather being forced

774
00:49:53,416 --> 00:49:56,808
beyond it by the very pressure of events, by the uncertainty of our times.

775
00:49:56,944 --> 00:50:00,216
And by the confusion and

776
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:03,780
instability of modern thought.

777
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,304
Which offers us no secure and

778
00:50:07,472 --> 00:50:10,060
humanly comfortable picture of the universe.

779
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,092
Well, first of all, it must be obvious that one

780
00:50:16,116 --> 00:50:19,260
of the things that is principally involved.

781
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:22,800
By a social system of communication.

782
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,320
Is that it is a form of what Korzybski has called time binding.

783
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:35,480
The whole possibility of thought and language involves a

784
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,920
codification of experience.

785
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:44,800
It involves a

786
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:49,220
form of thinking about

787
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:52,836
life. Which is basically,

788
00:50:52,948 --> 00:50:56,052
after all, description. Now,

789
00:50:56,076 --> 00:51:00,212
description is a

790
00:51:00,236 --> 00:51:04,452
way of coding, putting into symbols the

791
00:51:04,476 --> 00:51:08,640
events that go by us. And as

792
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,176
we begin to be able to put events into symbols.

793
00:51:12,288 --> 00:51:15,140
We develop most peculiar powers of memory.

794
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:21,280
It becomes much easier to recollect and to formalize what

795
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,880
has happened to us. And along with this, naturally goes the ability

796
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,460
to project our recollection.

797
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,460
Into thoughts about the future course of events.

798
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:36,858
And this, apparently, is something which primitive,

799
00:51:36,954 --> 00:51:40,730
very primitive types of human being. In which animals do

800
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:44,122
not do to any great extent. But the

801
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:47,610
price that is always paid for this ability to describe

802
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:51,562
and to prefigure what is going to happen to

803
00:51:51,586 --> 00:51:55,242
us. Is that it has a very, very alarming effect upon our

804
00:51:55,266 --> 00:51:58,820
emotions. Because we

805
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:02,724
are able, by being able to think about all sorts

806
00:52:02,772 --> 00:52:06,532
of future possibilities. To experience the emotions

807
00:52:06,596 --> 00:52:10,280
appropriate to those possibilities. As if they were present happenings.

808
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,852
In other words, the civilized man tends to be in a state

809
00:52:14,876 --> 00:52:18,868
of chronic worry and fear and anxiety. Because he's always

810
00:52:18,924 --> 00:52:22,570
confronted not with the simple actuality of what is happening before him.

811
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:25,770
But with the innumerable possibilities of what might happen.

812
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:31,470
And since, because of this, his emotional existence

813
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:35,486
tends to be in a chronic state of anxiety and tension,

814
00:52:35,678 --> 00:52:40,270
he loses increasingly the

815
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:45,290
ability to relate to

816
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:49,646
the concrete world. As it manifests

817
00:52:49,678 --> 00:52:53,930
itself to him. In the actual present in which he lives.

818
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:58,302
He becomes so tied up inside that, as it were, the channels of

819
00:52:58,326 --> 00:53:01,582
his sensibility become blocked. He gets a

820
00:53:01,606 --> 00:53:05,390
kind of neurological sclerosis. A kind

821
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:09,330
of inability to give himself

822
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:13,918
to be spontaneous, to be alive

823
00:53:14,014 --> 00:53:17,788
with full, joyous abandon. Thus, the more

824
00:53:17,844 --> 00:53:20,520
civilized we become, the more stuffy we get.

825
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:27,500
And therefore the various ways

826
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:32,444
of liberating oneself from society,

827
00:53:32,572 --> 00:53:36,444
of entering what the Indians call vanaprastha,

828
00:53:36,572 --> 00:53:39,440
the life of forest dweller going back to the forest.

829
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,880
When a person reaches a certain point in life. When he says, now, look here,

830
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,280
I've had enough of all this. I'm simply tired

831
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:53,372
of making life not in

832
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,748
the least bit worth living by Going through

833
00:53:56,804 --> 00:53:59,800
the horrors as to what might happen,

834
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:04,860
of going through all this in the name of efficiency

835
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,572
and membership in the community. Let me for

836
00:54:08,596 --> 00:54:11,712
a while get away from it all and find out what the scarlet stories for

837
00:54:11,736 --> 00:54:15,136
myself, I'm tired of being told what I ought

838
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:18,432
to believe. I'm tired of being told how I ought to see, how I

839
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:21,568
ought to behave, how I ought to feel. Let me

840
00:54:21,624 --> 00:54:24,220
find out for myself who I really am.

841
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,160
And so these institutions

842
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,424
of going back, as it were, to the shaman

843
00:54:33,472 --> 00:54:37,664
state of religion, of getting away from the community interpretation

844
00:54:37,712 --> 00:54:39,580
of how one ought to think and feel,

845
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:44,960
arise in very many great cultures of the past.

846
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,880
Now they arise, therefore, again today.

847
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:56,360
And it's perhaps impossible

848
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:01,172
and misleading to try and have what

849
00:55:01,196 --> 00:55:05,560
I would call authoritative attitude about this phase of man's

850
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:07,730
spiritual exploration.

851
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:13,198
Sometimes, for example, when a person wants to find out who he really is,

852
00:55:13,254 --> 00:55:16,942
he goes to a psychiatrist. And occasionally he

853
00:55:16,966 --> 00:55:20,622
will find a kind of psychiatrist who does not have an authoritative

854
00:55:20,686 --> 00:55:24,254
view of what human health is and who simply helps the individual

855
00:55:24,302 --> 00:55:27,150
to find his own way. Other times,

856
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:33,610
unfortunately, we will find doctrinaire psychotherapists

857
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:37,830
who think they know what an integrated, healthy and normal human being is,

858
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:41,270
and who have a whole theoretic pattern of what is

859
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:45,062
believed to be the actual fact of what

860
00:55:45,086 --> 00:55:48,902
I believe to be the actual facts of human nature, the actual design of

861
00:55:48,926 --> 00:55:53,014
the psyche. And they attempt, consciously or subconsciously,

862
00:55:53,062 --> 00:55:56,050
to wangle the patient into accepting this view.

863
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:03,140
Alternatively, we may get from the Orient accounts

864
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,232
books about authorities, about their ways of

865
00:56:07,256 --> 00:56:10,896
liberation, which in many cases, however, have tended to harden

866
00:56:10,928 --> 00:56:14,592
into an orthodoxy and to present a traditional spiritual

867
00:56:14,656 --> 00:56:18,384
experience just as if they were the kind of spiritual experiences

868
00:56:18,432 --> 00:56:21,360
which it is the function of that social officer, the priest,

869
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,420
to impart.

870
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:28,026
And thus when we get swamis

871
00:56:28,138 --> 00:56:32,154
representing an orthodox interpretation of Indian

872
00:56:32,242 --> 00:56:35,510
moksha or liberation, or when we get

873
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:40,314
even Zen masters representing perhaps an orthodox

874
00:56:40,362 --> 00:56:43,866
Buddhist experience, or seeming to represent one,

875
00:56:44,018 --> 00:56:47,242
we should be suspicious. Because these are the

876
00:56:47,266 --> 00:56:50,350
kind of experiences which cannot be transmitted,

877
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:54,414
which, for their very nature, are something which one

878
00:56:54,482 --> 00:56:58,198
finds out for oneself and which

879
00:56:58,254 --> 00:57:01,830
looks, they could be explained, if they could be transmitted, would not

880
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:04,690
be the very thing which they are intended to be.

881
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:10,278
Because they are discoverers of

882
00:57:10,334 --> 00:57:14,102
something authentic, of something genuine, of something which is firsthand

883
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:17,770
between oneself and one's universe.

884
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:21,910
And thus it's in the nature of things that they

885
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:25,734
can't be codified, they can't be made a factor in social

886
00:57:25,822 --> 00:57:26,890
communication.

887
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:33,510
And so it is that it is, in a way, fortunate that

888
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:38,310
we here in the Western world do

889
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:42,518
not have too Many authoritative

890
00:57:42,614 --> 00:57:46,524
masters and teachers to whom we feel we can now go

891
00:57:46,662 --> 00:57:50,320
for enlightenment. More and more of us, I think, tend to feel that

892
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:54,976
we are all alone together, whistling in the dark, that we haven't a savior.

893
00:57:55,088 --> 00:57:58,620
There is no statesman clever enough to understand

894
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,528
the frightful tangle of international affairs. Or really

895
00:58:02,584 --> 00:58:07,712
to do anything very much about it. There is no psychologist

896
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:11,536
or physician or philosopher. Who really impresses

897
00:58:11,568 --> 00:58:15,210
us as having the last word on everything. More and

898
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:18,030
more, each one of us are thrown on our own resources.

899
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:21,790
This seems to me to be a perfectly excellent state of affairs.

900
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:26,510
So that we become, in a symbolic sense, back in the forest.

901
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:31,626
Like the hunter of old. Who has nobody

902
00:58:31,658 --> 00:58:34,714
around him to tell him how he ought to feel and how he ought to

903
00:58:34,722 --> 00:58:38,314
use his senses. And must therefore make his own exploration

904
00:58:38,362 --> 00:58:41,900
and find out for himself. But you

905
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:45,852
know, when you study the records of these self discoveries, the fascinating

906
00:58:45,916 --> 00:58:49,260
thing is that there seems to be such

907
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,508
a common measure of agreement between all

908
00:58:52,564 --> 00:58:54,880
those who find out for themselves.

909
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:59,788
And yet always the way in which he has to find out.

910
00:58:59,844 --> 00:59:03,420
Is not through seeking agreement with others, not trying to

911
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,880
find what others have found, but only to

912
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,256
find what his own senses and his own direct experience

913
00:59:10,408 --> 00:59:13,552
tell him. When he, as it were, goes into his

914
00:59:13,576 --> 00:59:16,860
inner closet, goes into his own secret place

915
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:23,820
and asks for

916
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,480
a direct encounter with

917
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,962
the world. And no longer,

918
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:35,226
as it were, looks out of the corner of his eyes to see if everybody

919
00:59:35,258 --> 00:59:37,910
else is doing the same thing and getting the same results.

920
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:42,794
It is in this sense that a person becomes, in the truest sense

921
00:59:42,842 --> 00:59:47,070
of the word, a self. An original,

922
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:51,194
authoritative source of life. As distinct

923
00:59:51,242 --> 00:59:54,910
from a person in its original sense,

924
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:59,006
a mask, a role that he is playing

925
00:59:59,078 --> 00:59:59,790
in a society.
