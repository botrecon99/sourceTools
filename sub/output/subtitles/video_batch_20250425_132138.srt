1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,896
This is a point of view which is successful

2
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:05,740
to a certain degree.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,616
It goes well up to a certain level, after which it begins

4
00:00:10,648 --> 00:00:12,220
to develop complications.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,752
As I think it over, it seems to me that the high civilizations of

6
00:00:21,776 --> 00:00:25,224
the world have produced exactly three

7
00:00:25,312 --> 00:00:29,580
different views of the constitution of nature,

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,900
of the physical universe.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,176
And to enumerate them, I would call them, respectively,

10
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:41,100
nature as a construct, nature as a drama,

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,140
and nature as an organism.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,088
The first view, nature as a construct, has, until very

13
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:53,780
recently, been characteristic of the Western world.

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,126
The view of nature as a drama has been largely

15
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:02,742
characteristic of India. And finally

16
00:01:02,806 --> 00:01:06,102
of nature as an organism has been

17
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:08,090
characteristic of the Far East.

18
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,950
I'd like to compare these three views and point

19
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,758
out certain

20
00:01:16,814 --> 00:01:20,342
of their advantages, disadvantages, and the

21
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:23,450
ways in which they complement each other.

22
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,410
And I think part of the interest of this is that our thinking,

23
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,038
more and more I've been fascinated by this, that our thinking

24
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:37,086
about the world is strongly

25
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:39,170
influenced by analogies,

26
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,494
by sometimes analogies that are almost hidden.

27
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:50,180
They're so far back in the history of the

28
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,212
thought of any given civilization or culture that

29
00:01:54,236 --> 00:01:57,268
they are taken as something more than analogies. They're taken

30
00:01:57,404 --> 00:02:00,040
almost, you could say, as logical patterns.

31
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,316
And they are basic to our grammar, to our common

32
00:02:05,348 --> 00:02:09,380
sense, and to our attitudes in

33
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,560
ways that often go unsuspected.

34
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,890
Why don't we start with the Western view of the world

35
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,570
as a construct? By this

36
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,978
I mean the physical world has

37
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:29,090
historically in the west been looked upon as a

38
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,710
created or manufactured article,

39
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,030
the work of a creator external to the world.

40
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,748
And this view has continued in many ways even

41
00:02:44,804 --> 00:02:48,732
after the rise of deism in the 18th century and the general tendency

42
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:52,012
of the scientists to dispense with the

43
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:53,840
hypothesis of the Creator.

44
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,132
The idea still remains that the world is

45
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:02,572
a construct analogous to a

46
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:06,204
machine. And indeed, obeying laws

47
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,672
or plans in the same way as a machine obeys a

48
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,400
blueprint. Even though the

49
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,260
lawgiver and the planner himself seems to have disappeared.

50
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,792
The basic metaphor, though underlying this, is not so

51
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:28,280
much the machine as the.

52
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,800
The work of clay, the pot, or the sculpture

53
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,420
of the modeled figure.

54
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,066
For as you know, it is said in the book of Genesis that the Lord

55
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:42,258
God created Adam out of the dust of the ground and breathed

56
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:44,870
the breath of life into his nostrils.

57
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,978
And so our language, our poetry, is full of

58
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:57,522
allusions to the

59
00:03:57,546 --> 00:04:01,542
fact that we are really, after all, clay imperial

60
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:05,126
Caesar, dead and turned to clay, might stop a hole

61
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:06,530
to keep the wind away.

62
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,530
And because of this figure,

63
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,250
it is, as I have often said,

64
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,414
fundamental to our common sense. That the world

65
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:23,142
is formed, matter the

66
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:26,170
form being the shape of the part, the matter being the clay.

67
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,680
And thus we think of life as being basically

68
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,372
something done to a medium. The medium

69
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:41,948
is stuff, a kind of formless and

70
00:04:42,084 --> 00:04:45,760
of itself inert and unintelligent goo,

71
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,120
which requires an external agency

72
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,130
to give it form and intelligence and life.

73
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,590
And naturally, because we have thought this way for so long,

74
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,654
it's a terribly difficult idea to abandon, to get out of our heads

75
00:05:05,702 --> 00:05:10,342
the notion that in

76
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:14,890
the same way that tables are made of wood and houses of stone,

77
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,462
so we tend to think that trees are made

78
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:23,250
of wood and mountains of stone and people

79
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,222
of flesh, and all of it eventually reducing itself

80
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:29,450
to the primordial goo,

81
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,810
the universal clay, the primal matter,

82
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,430
the formless original

83
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,286
water over which the spirit of God is said to have moved

84
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:45,170
in the beginning of all time.

85
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,536
Now, beyond the idea

86
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:56,880
of the the world as a

87
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,216
work of pottery lies the more sophisticated idea

88
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:04,784
of the world as a mechanism. In this Western

89
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:07,220
view of the world as a construct,

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,890
as soon as men began to understand mechanical

91
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,470
principles, it became extraordinarily convenient

92
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,194
to make analogies between various

93
00:06:23,242 --> 00:06:26,986
types of machinery and

94
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:30,730
things to be found in the world. And it is really

95
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,978
upon this analogy that the great achievements of

96
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:37,510
Western technology have hitherto been based.

97
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,540
And it's really very difficult to think that we

98
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,220
could have devised our technology and that our practical

99
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,716
sciences could have made such progress without

100
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:56,092
the idea of the analogy between the world and a

101
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,520
constructed machine.

102
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,668
You see, one of the most fundamental things

103
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:07,000
about a machine is that it is an assemblage of parts.

104
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,060
And the successful measurement and

105
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,092
description of nature depends

106
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:21,092
upon the calculus, upon reducing it to parts. You know,

107
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:24,440
the word calculus originally meant pebbles.

108
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,280
And pebbles were one of the oldest methods of calculating,

109
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,130
counting pebbles in a funny

110
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,890
kind of association of words.

111
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:46,158
Calculus is also calculating

112
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:49,246
in the sense of having a calculating attitude.

113
00:07:49,438 --> 00:07:50,450
Scheming.

114
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,268
And scheming is associated with. With turning things to

115
00:07:57,324 --> 00:07:59,160
calculi or stones.

116
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,164
It is a sort of killing

117
00:08:06,212 --> 00:08:09,960
the world, reducing it from the living to the dead,

118
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,760
from the organism to the machine. But nevertheless,

119
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,236
it has had the most marvelous consequences so far as we are concerned.

120
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:23,092
And the cultures which thought of nature by analogy with drama and

121
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:26,372
by analogy with organism, did not produce the

122
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:29,940
technology that we in the west produced. Let me just

123
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,440
for a moment contrast the other attitudes.

124
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,120
The Indian attitude of the world is a drama.

125
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,412
In Hindu thought, the world is not thought of as

126
00:08:41,516 --> 00:08:44,280
being made or constructed by God,

127
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,926
but as being actually God himself playing

128
00:08:49,998 --> 00:08:53,334
a game. The idea

129
00:08:53,382 --> 00:08:57,530
of one single divine actor

130
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,582
who is playing all the parts of all

131
00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:05,890
the creatures in the world imagining himself to be them,

132
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,126
assuming as it were myriads of masks

133
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:15,062
behind which there is simply one wearer of the

134
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:15,770
mask.

135
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,200
In a forthcoming book,

136
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,252
the second volume of the Masks of God, it's not published yet, but I've just

137
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:30,400
seen a copy, Joseph Campbell contrasts

138
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,252
the way in which the myth of the one who became

139
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:37,080
two, the one that became many,

140
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,740
has gone in two quite different directions.

141
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,646
Beginning in ancient Sumeria,

142
00:09:44,838 --> 00:09:48,250
which constitutes, as it were, a sort of cultural watershed,

143
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,530
it has flowed eastwards in one way and westwards in another

144
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,770
to the east. The idea that the One,

145
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,350
the Godhead, in other words, split itself and

146
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,222
dismembered itself into many parts quite voluntarily, and thus became

147
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:09,052
the world as a play to

148
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:12,348
the West. The theme of the one who became many

149
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,680
is different because, as he points out in the Book of Genesis,

150
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,676
it is not the divine who becomes male

151
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,452
and female, it is the creature. In the Upanishads,

152
00:10:23,596 --> 00:10:26,240
say the Brihad Dharanyaka Upanishad,

153
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,400
the divine self,

154
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,940
is described as a saying

155
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,428
in the beginning of time, let me become two. And he splits into male

156
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:39,732
and female, and thus generates the world. But in the Book of

157
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:42,772
Genesis, it is not the Godhead who splits,

158
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:46,804
it is man, the creature who is split into Adam

159
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:48,280
and then into Eve.

160
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,532
But thus, in the eastern world, we have the dramatic

161
00:10:54,596 --> 00:10:58,756
view. In India in particular. And although

162
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:02,148
it's interesting to note that in, say, in the writings

163
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:06,530
of the great philosopher Shankara

164
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:11,010
and others, you very often encounter the analogy of the potter

165
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,566
or of pots as representing the world, the roles

166
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:16,610
are reversed.

167
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,350
The it is the clay is used as the

168
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,210
symbol for the divine reality.

169
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,390
Just as pots are all made of clay, or as

170
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,258
jewels are all made of gold, so all

171
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:39,114
things in the world are of one divine substance, which is of the nature

172
00:11:39,162 --> 00:11:42,762
of the Godhead or Brahman. It's interesting,

173
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:45,310
the different use of the simile.

174
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,994
And so from the standpoint of the dramatic

175
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:53,470
view of the universe,

176
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,036
all the divisions and distinctions of the world are looked

177
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:04,240
upon as being a kind of. As if

178
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,560
they are in play, they are not quite serious.

179
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,700
And this contrasts very sharply with

180
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,052
what has been the characteristic Western view that the distinctions in

181
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:23,280
the world are the most important things about it,

182
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,502
that they are deeply serious. The distinction

183
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:32,214
of good and evil is an eternal distinction, as is the

184
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:35,290
distinction between the Creator and the creature.

185
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,130
The world, in this view, is not a drama.

186
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,610
It is played not by actors,

187
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:49,078
but by what we call real individuals,

188
00:12:49,174 --> 00:12:52,422
even real persons, although, funnily enough, as I

189
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:57,140
suppose you know, the word person is originally Persona,

190
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,820
the megaphone mask worn by actors

191
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,900
in classical Greek drama.

192
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,096
Then thirdly, there is the organic view characteristic

193
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:14,860
of China.

194
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,130
In this, there is no real thought of there

195
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,714
being a divine creator or a divine actor behind

196
00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:28,730
the world, but rather the world is

197
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,650
thought of as being self moving

198
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,730
and self creating. The word for

199
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,234
nature in Chinese means what is of itself.

200
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:45,440
So when

201
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,480
in the West a child asks its mother,

202
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,060
who made me? And she replies,

203
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,660
darling, God made you. And the child asks, but who

204
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,680
made God? She has to say, nobody made God.

205
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,920
And that is a great puzzle to the child who thinks

206
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,460
of the world as a construction.

207
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,662
And it may be explained to

208
00:14:15,686 --> 00:14:19,326
the child, if you like, that God makes himself.

209
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:23,410
He exists of himself because he is existence.

210
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,730
To put it in more theological language,

211
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,890
he has the attribute called aseity,

212
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:36,530
from the Latin assay. By himself.

213
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,682
Perhaps some kind of infant terrible would

214
00:14:43,706 --> 00:14:47,250
ask the question, well, if that's true of God,

215
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,802
why couldn't it be true of the world in the first place? Why did

216
00:14:50,826 --> 00:14:54,322
you have to make that additional step? If he did so,

217
00:14:54,346 --> 00:14:57,870
he would be thinking more or less in the Chinese way,

218
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,930
which does not think of the world either as an

219
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,820
artifact or of some maker, or as a mask

220
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,092
or appearance worn by some sort of deeper

221
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:14,660
reality. He doesn't, in other words,

222
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,580
have a two level view

223
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,468
of nature as an appearance, underneath which

224
00:15:22,524 --> 00:15:25,440
there is something else to explain it.

225
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,120
He sees it all rather as self evident,

226
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,100
as being something which regulates itself

227
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,140
and indeed orders itself.

228
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,528
There is a certain sense, you see, in which the Chinese view

229
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:49,580
is fundamentally, or you could almost call it anarchical,

230
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,580
or if you don't like that word, you could call it democratic.

231
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,700
A world which is self governing,

232
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,090
not even through a president,

233
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,814
but self governing in every way. A great and colossal

234
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:10,730
anarchism which

235
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,310
moves itself in the same way as you and

236
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,050
I move our fingers,

237
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,510
without directing them in the sense that we know exactly what

238
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,270
we're doing and how we move them, we don't.

239
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,090
Now, I've said that the

240
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,330
Western view is probably what

241
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,994
made it possible for us to develop

242
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:45,070
our highly advanced technology.

243
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,330
By thinking about the world as a construction,

244
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,652
we could think about the laws or principles

245
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:58,796
or plans or regularities upon

246
00:16:58,828 --> 00:16:59,960
which it was based.

247
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,440
We could think, for example, of the calculus of number

248
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,340
as the basic

249
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,196
characteristic of the law upon

250
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:16,680
which nature is based.

251
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,192
By doing that, we caught onto the idea of thinking

252
00:17:22,256 --> 00:17:25,184
of all things as reducible to atoms,

253
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:26,900
to parts, to bits.

254
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,872
And then by thinking of bits, we found that

255
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:35,552
we could measure the world very accurately,

256
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:38,500
describe its regularities very accurately.

257
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,020
And that gave us an astonishing degree of control over it.

258
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,936
But this is a point of view which is successful

259
00:17:51,128 --> 00:17:52,780
to a certain degree.

260
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,656
It goes well up to a certain level. After which it begins

261
00:17:57,688 --> 00:17:59,260
to develop complications.

262
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,432
For one thing, you could say it has complications. Which are psychological

263
00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:10,980
on the one hand. And practical and technical on another.

264
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,830
From the psychological point of view,

265
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,906
its complication is that when it becomes

266
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:24,590
commonsensical to us to look at the world as a mechanism.

267
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,834
We begin as humans, as people

268
00:18:29,922 --> 00:18:33,674
capable of feeling and love. To feel the external

269
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:36,150
world rather alien to us.

270
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,240
Yes, it's a machine.

271
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:46,520
It's a great big automatic

272
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,000
mechanical arrangement.

273
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,700
Which in essence is simply stupid

274
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,400
energy.

275
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,930
We thereupon feel that it has nothing in common

276
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:12,158
with ourselves. And perhaps even

277
00:19:12,214 --> 00:19:16,190
though we try to give the same sort of account of

278
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,582
ourselves. And try to reduce our brains and emotions

279
00:19:19,646 --> 00:19:22,690
to some kind of neurological computer mechanism.

280
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,770
That makes us, in a way, hate ourselves.

281
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,580
For as soon as we start thinking of ourselves as automata.

282
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,728
We begin ethically and psychologically

283
00:19:38,824 --> 00:19:42,460
treating ourselves as automata. We lose respect for ourselves.

284
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,980
And thereupon feel

285
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,130
that what is central to us.

286
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,130
The feeling center, the person,

287
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,014
is trapped in a cosmos.

288
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:06,530
That is a mechanical nightmare,

289
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,530
foreign and strange.

290
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,810
We can see ourselves as a kind of ghastly accident.

291
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,138
And I don't wonder that this engenders.

292
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:25,870
Certain kinds of suicidal tendencies in our culture.

293
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,830
So much for the psychological point of view. From the technical point of view,

294
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,510
the analogy of nature with mechanism.

295
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,190
Develops its own disadvantages. After a certain point.

296
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,468
That is to say, the disadvantage of trying to

297
00:20:48,524 --> 00:20:52,920
manage the physical universe. As if it were indeed

298
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,300
an assemblage of separate parts or

299
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,348
separable parts. For the first sort

300
00:21:01,364 --> 00:21:05,540
of person to notice this mistake. Would be the

301
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,280
extreme surgical or medical specialist.

302
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,316
Who knows, for example, all about hearts

303
00:21:13,348 --> 00:21:17,860
or about stomachs. But very little about brains or lungs

304
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,000
or glands. And who treats

305
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,368
one organ at a time. And becomes unaware of the imbalances

306
00:21:26,464 --> 00:21:29,744
inflicted upon other organs. By what he's done to the organ in

307
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:31,140
which he specializes.

308
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,912
Also, in the same way, the specialist

309
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:40,368
always tends to

310
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:44,400
see the units of nature. And to be unaware

311
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,140
of their connections or relations. Relationships which

312
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,240
are, after all, inseparable relationships with all the other parts.

313
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,524
There is, you might say, also another technical disadvantage,

314
00:21:58,572 --> 00:22:02,012
again. Which develops only in the course of time. To this

315
00:22:02,036 --> 00:22:04,000
particular mechanical analogy.

316
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,740
And that is that when you

317
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,180
begin to rely more and

318
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:13,800
more.

319
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,830
Upon minute

320
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:24,230
and careful description of the world for

321
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,622
dealing with it. And that, of course, involves the reduction of the world to

322
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,210
describable units.

323
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,050
The world then becomes terribly complicated.

324
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:40,294
And it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of

325
00:22:40,382 --> 00:22:43,290
all the minute units that, that you've described.

326
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,782
Hence the difficulty of specialists in the various sciences communicating with

327
00:22:47,806 --> 00:22:51,750
each other, and the difficulty of the scientific specialist in

328
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,670
communicating with the layman. The whole thing becomes

329
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,570
much too complicated to manage.

330
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:04,070
And this then means that the

331
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,002
more we know, the greater our skill

332
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:11,850
in managing the world as a mechanical

333
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,610
construct, the more

334
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:18,954
difficult it becomes to control, because it becomes

335
00:23:19,002 --> 00:23:22,890
increasingly complex. We talk endlessly about the

336
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:26,150
increasing complexity of political,

337
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,962
social and economic affairs which

338
00:23:30,146 --> 00:23:33,710
makes the problems of the world increasingly unintelligible

339
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,470
to even the average well educated citizen.

340
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,150
Now, it has been suggested that

341
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,350
the Western view,

342
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:53,250
nature as a construct, has in some ways done

343
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,110
its job,

344
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:02,478
and that from here on we need to

345
00:24:02,534 --> 00:24:06,318
explore to a greater degree other

346
00:24:06,374 --> 00:24:10,450
views. Perhaps the organic view of the Chinese,

347
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:19,182
wherein we

348
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:23,198
get a peculiar harmony of points of view with

349
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:26,940
our own sciences, biology, ecology and so

350
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,428
forth, as if somehow

351
00:24:30,524 --> 00:24:33,820
this view had been tucked away in

352
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,996
a store cupboard, waiting for us

353
00:24:38,148 --> 00:24:41,692
to be available at just the time when we

354
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:42,680
needed it.

355
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,320
The problem here is an entirely new one,

356
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,808
because we are so used to thinking of our problems

357
00:24:55,824 --> 00:25:00,240
of controlling and understanding the world in

358
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,940
terms of the methods of mechanical science.

359
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,900
Not so long ago,

360
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,472
I was talking to Lynn White,

361
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:18,100
who used to be president of Mills College,

362
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,230
and he was saying that our academic world

363
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,590
values only three kinds of intelligence,

364
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,762
whereas he said there are many more. There are at least seven.

365
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:35,538
I don't remember what all the seven were, but he said the kinds

366
00:25:35,554 --> 00:25:39,750
of intelligence that we value are first of all mnemonic,

367
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,230
which is the ability to remember,

368
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:46,550
computational intelligence, the ability to figure,

369
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,238
and verbal intelligence, the ability to read,

370
00:25:50,294 --> 00:25:54,930
write and talk. But he said there is also social intelligence,

371
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,530
and there is also kinesthetic intelligence,

372
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,150
kind of intelligence, kinesthetic, in which we learn as

373
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,630
children to walk, to run, to throw and catch balls,

374
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:11,150
and to do all kinds of extremely complex and

375
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,290
very subtle actions without being able to describe

376
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:19,010
or count what we're doing.

377
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,430
Perhaps in handling far more complex

378
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:30,930
matters than catching balls or

379
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,530
skiing or riding bicycles,

380
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,410
we may have unknown resources of kinesthetic intelligence

381
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,570
for dealing with some of the problems that now face us.

382
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,294
Here is the germ of an idea which

383
00:26:50,382 --> 00:26:53,570
Chinese culture and Far Eastern culture in general

384
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:58,150
suggest to us. Perhaps they themselves

385
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,490
have only dimly begun to explore these things.

386
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:07,280
But I think that it's in that direction that

387
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,136
the future of practical philosophy and government

388
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:12,740
of the world may lie.

389
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,208
Well, now, there are, as I said in the history of mankind,

390
00:27:22,304 --> 00:27:26,112
three theories of nature. The first theory

391
00:27:26,176 --> 00:27:29,940
is the Western theory, which is that nature

392
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,650
is a machine or an artifact.

393
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,770
We inherit this from the Hebrews,

394
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,062
who believed that nature was made

395
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:48,454
by God in somewhat the same way as a

396
00:27:48,462 --> 00:27:51,702
potter makes a pot out of clay or a

397
00:27:51,726 --> 00:27:54,810
carpenter makes a table out of wood.

398
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:58,286
It is not insignificant that Jesus is the son

399
00:27:58,318 --> 00:27:59,570
of the carpenter.

400
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,830
Our tradition has been to look upon the

401
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,490
world as a construct.

402
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,130
And somebody knows how it was put together.

403
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,990
Somebody understands, and that is the

404
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,130
constructor, the architect, the Lord God.

405
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,696
But it so happened that in the 18th century,

406
00:28:25,888 --> 00:28:30,144
Western thought began to change. They became

407
00:28:30,192 --> 00:28:33,680
increasingly doubtful as to whether there was a

408
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,380
maker, whether there was a God.

409
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,992
But they continued to look upon the creation as an

410
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:44,180
artifact, as a machine.

411
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,580
And by the time of Newton,

412
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,270
people were explaining the world in terms of

413
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:55,062
mechanism. And we are still under the

414
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:59,094
influence of that idea. Because, after all, in things like Life magazine

415
00:28:59,142 --> 00:29:02,502
and so on, when they give you an article

416
00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:05,210
on human physiology,

417
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,910
they usually make drawings which show

418
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,970
the human being as a kind of mechanism,

419
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,402
as a sort of factory. And they show how the

420
00:29:17,426 --> 00:29:21,370
peristaltic action carries the food in and how it's processed

421
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,626
by this organ and that organ as just as if a certain

422
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:29,706
product is fed into a factory cow at one end and it comes out canned

423
00:29:29,738 --> 00:29:33,130
corned beef at the other. Just in such

424
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,650
a way the human is illustrated. And so too,

425
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:40,426
in some kinds of rather degraded medicine

426
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:43,996
that is now practiced. When you go to the hospital

427
00:29:44,148 --> 00:29:47,740
for a medical examination, you are treated as a machine.

428
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,292
They process you. You're not a person. You are

429
00:29:51,316 --> 00:29:54,620
put in a wheelchair immediately. Even if you look

430
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,400
perfectly healthy and can walk, nevertheless, they have to have you in this wheelchair,

431
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,524
and they put you through a process. And the heart specialist

432
00:30:02,572 --> 00:30:06,348
looks only at your heart because he can't understand anything else. The Oto

433
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:09,514
rhino laryngologist, which. Which means an ear, nose and throat man,

434
00:30:09,602 --> 00:30:12,554
looks at that section of you, and he doesn't know about anything else.

435
00:30:12,682 --> 00:30:16,266
And maybe a psychiatrist takes a look at you, and goodness

436
00:30:16,298 --> 00:30:20,042
knows what happens there, and so on and so on. Everybody looks at you from

437
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:23,754
their specialized point of view as if they were a bunch of mechanics examining

438
00:30:23,802 --> 00:30:27,290
your automobile. Because, as I said

439
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,794
last night, we just asked for this

440
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:35,380
because most of us consider ourselves as chauffeurs

441
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,272
inside our bodies, which we own in the same way as you

442
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:43,552
own a car, and when it goes wrong, you take it to the mechanic to

443
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:46,832
fix it. You don't really identify

444
00:30:46,896 --> 00:30:50,300
with your body, just as you don't really identify with your car.

445
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,536
So here is this whole theory of nature which has grown

446
00:30:55,568 --> 00:30:58,816
up in the west as an artifact,

447
00:30:58,928 --> 00:31:02,122
something made. Now,

448
00:31:02,146 --> 00:31:06,270
let Me take a second theory of nature. This is an Indian theory,

449
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,858
East Indian nature,

450
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:13,630
not as an artifact, but as drama.

451
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,378
Basic to all Hindu thought is the idea that the world is

452
00:31:18,434 --> 00:31:21,946
Maya. That is a Sanskrit word which

453
00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:24,350
means many things. It means magic,

454
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,190
illusion, art,

455
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,700
play. All the world's a stage.

456
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,792
And in the Hindu idea there is the ultimate reality of

457
00:31:36,816 --> 00:31:40,552
the universe is the Self, which they

458
00:31:40,576 --> 00:31:43,500
call Brahman or Atman.

459
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,380
That's what there is, the Self,

460
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,448
Universal, eternal, boundless,

461
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:55,318
indescribable. And everything

462
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:58,822
that happens, happens on the self. Like you say,

463
00:31:58,926 --> 00:32:02,290
it's on me. The drinks tonight are on me.

464
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,890
Or like we say, when you hear the radio,

465
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:11,382
it's on the speaker. You see everything you

466
00:32:11,406 --> 00:32:12,650
hear on the radio.

467
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,606
Flutes, drums, human voices,

468
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:21,094
traffic noises, any imaginable sound.

469
00:32:21,222 --> 00:32:25,276
All those sounds are vibrations of the diaphragm in the speaker.

470
00:32:25,468 --> 00:32:27,560
But the radio doesn't tell you that.

471
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,640
The announcer doesn't come on and say every morning,

472
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,600
good morning, ladies and gentlemen, this is kqed.

473
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,108
The following sounds that you are going to hear are vibrations of

474
00:32:40,164 --> 00:32:43,628
your the diaphragm in your speaker. And they're not

475
00:32:43,764 --> 00:32:47,804
really human voices or musical

476
00:32:47,852 --> 00:32:51,500
instruments, but just that, they never let you in on that.

477
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,696
And in exactly the same way the universe doesn't

478
00:32:57,728 --> 00:33:01,232
let you in on the truth that all sense

479
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:04,816
experiences are vibrations

480
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:08,400
of the self, not just

481
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,984
yourself, but the self. And all of us

482
00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:16,074
share this self in common because. Because it is pretending

483
00:33:16,122 --> 00:33:17,510
to be all of us.

484
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:22,842
Brahman, the ultimate principle,

485
00:33:22,986 --> 00:33:25,150
plays hide and seek eternally.

486
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:30,154
And he does it for unspeakably long periods of time. The Hindus measure

487
00:33:30,202 --> 00:33:34,138
time in what is called a Kalpa K, a LPA.

488
00:33:34,234 --> 00:33:37,030
That's 4,320,000 years.

489
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:41,230
Don't take this seriously. It's not meant to be taken literally,

490
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,770
but just for an unspeakably long time. The Brahman,

491
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:50,378
the self, pretends that it's lost and

492
00:33:50,434 --> 00:33:54,186
is us. And all our adventures and all our troubles

493
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:57,990
and all our agonies and tragedies, it gets mixed up in them.

494
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,258
Then, after the period of 4,320,000 years has elapsed,

495
00:34:03,354 --> 00:34:06,724
there is a catastrophe. The universe

496
00:34:06,772 --> 00:34:09,940
is destroyed in fire. And after

497
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,740
that, the Brahmin wakes up and says,

498
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,972
well, good crazy. What, what an adventure that

499
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:18,800
was. He wipes the sweat off his brow and says,

500
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:23,848
let's rest a while. So for another 4,000,320 000

501
00:34:23,894 --> 00:34:27,508
years, the Divine self rests and knows who it is.

502
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:30,580
It's me. Then it says, well,

503
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:34,146
this is rather boring. Let's get going again. Let's get mixed

504
00:34:34,178 --> 00:34:37,710
up. And it does it in a very strange way because

505
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:42,082
the way the Hindus time it, the first period of

506
00:34:42,266 --> 00:34:45,682
getting mixed up, getting lost, is beautiful. That's the

507
00:34:45,706 --> 00:34:49,634
longest period. Everything's right,

508
00:34:49,722 --> 00:34:53,282
it's just life is glorious. Then it has the next period in which

509
00:34:53,306 --> 00:34:57,026
things get a little wonky. Something is vaguely

510
00:34:57,058 --> 00:35:00,110
out of order that doesn't last so long.

511
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,114
Then the next period, the third, is when good and evil

512
00:35:04,162 --> 00:35:05,590
are equally balanced.

513
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:10,482
And that's still not so long. Finally comes the

514
00:35:10,506 --> 00:35:13,810
shortest period when everything bad triumphs and

515
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,190
the whole thing blows up and we begin all over again.

516
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,658
We're supposed to be living in that now. It's what's

517
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:24,348
called the Kali Yuga, the Age of

518
00:35:24,404 --> 00:35:28,413
Darkness. And it began on Friday, February 23,

519
00:35:28,613 --> 00:35:34,172
3123 BC and it

520
00:35:34,196 --> 00:35:35,960
has 5,000 years to run.

521
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,720
But as it goes on, time gets faster, so don't worry.

522
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,370
So you see, that's a theory of nature as a drama,

523
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:59,414
it's a play. Now, there's a third theory

524
00:35:59,462 --> 00:36:02,010
of nature which is Chinese,

525
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,130
and this is very interesting.

526
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:11,190
The Chinese word for nature they

527
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:14,644
call zhang.

528
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:17,824
And this expression means of itself.

529
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:21,408
So what happens of

530
00:36:21,464 --> 00:36:25,008
itself? Or we might say

531
00:36:25,064 --> 00:36:29,056
spontaneity. It almost means

532
00:36:29,128 --> 00:36:33,088
automatic, because automatic is what is self moving.

533
00:36:33,264 --> 00:36:37,460
Only we associate the word automatic with machinery.

534
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,930
But what is

535
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:45,450
of so of itself is associated in the Chinese mind not with

536
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:48,430
machinery, but with biology.

537
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,922
Your hair grows by itself, you don't have to

538
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:56,154
think how to grow it. Your heart beats by itself.

539
00:36:56,282 --> 00:36:59,270
You don't have to make up your mind how to beat it.

540
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,690
That's what they mean by nature. The poem

541
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,306
says, sitting quietly, doing nothing. Spring comes

542
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,390
and grass grows of itself.

543
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,362
So their principle of nature is called a dao.

544
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:18,314
Tao pronounced dao in the Mandarin

545
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:22,190
dialect, Tao in the Shanghai dialect,

546
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,470
to in the Cantonese dialect. Take your choice.

547
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:33,150
Dao means the course of nature.

548
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,182
And Lao Tzu, who was a philosopher who

549
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:42,250
lived little later than 400 B.C.

550
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,758
wrote a book about the dao. And he said the dao

551
00:37:46,854 --> 00:37:50,090
which can be spoken is not the eternal dao.

552
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:54,230
You can't describe it. He said,

553
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:57,690
the principle of the dao is spontaneity.

554
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:02,022
He said, the great Dao flows everywhere, both to the

555
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,678
left and to the right. It loves and nourishes all things,

556
00:38:05,734 --> 00:38:09,934
but does not lord it over them. It accomplishes merits

557
00:38:10,062 --> 00:38:12,010
and lays no claim to them.

558
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:17,982
So there is a very great difference between the Chinese

559
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:21,454
idea of dao as the informing

560
00:38:21,502 --> 00:38:25,214
principle of nature and the Judeo Christian

561
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:28,414
idea of God as nature's lord

562
00:38:28,462 --> 00:38:32,184
and master. Because the Dao

563
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:35,260
does not act as a boss.

564
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,680
In the Chinese philosophy of nature, nature has

565
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,060
no boss.

566
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,184
There is no principle

567
00:38:50,312 --> 00:38:54,024
that forces things to behave the way they do. It is

568
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:57,460
a comparison completely democratic theory of nature.

569
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,660
Do you mind if I talk for a while about something I love

570
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,400
about water and the ocean? Ever since

571
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,552
I can remember anything at all, the light,

572
00:39:11,736 --> 00:39:15,232
the smell, the sound and motion of the sea has

573
00:39:15,256 --> 00:39:16,580
been pure magic.

574
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:23,910
Even the mere intimation of its perfect gulls

575
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,690
flying a little way inland,

576
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:30,790
the quality of light in the sky beyond, hills which

577
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:34,102
screen it from view, the lowing of

578
00:39:34,126 --> 00:39:37,942
fog horns in the night. If ever I have to get away from it

579
00:39:37,966 --> 00:39:41,334
all, and in the words of a Chinese

580
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:44,570
poet, wash all the rungs of life from my pores,

581
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:49,354
there's simply nothing better. And to climb out onto a

582
00:39:49,362 --> 00:39:52,970
rock and sit for hours with nothing in sight but sea and

583
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:56,954
sky. Although the rhythm of the waves beats

584
00:39:57,002 --> 00:40:00,874
a kind of time, it's not clock or calendar

585
00:40:00,922 --> 00:40:05,162
time. It has no urgency. It's timeless

586
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:09,402
time. Because I

587
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:12,890
know I'm listening to a rhythm which has been

588
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,030
just the same for millions of years.

589
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:21,410
And it takes you out of the world of relentlessly ticking clocks.

590
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,650
Clocks, for some reason or other, always seem to be marching.

591
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:29,650
And armies never march to anything but doom.

592
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,890
But there's no marching rhythm. Motion waves.

593
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,010
It harmonizes with the breath.

594
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,410
It does not count our days.

595
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,624
Its pulse is not in the stingy

596
00:40:45,672 --> 00:40:49,020
spirit of measuring, of marking out how much still remains.

597
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,260
It's the breathing of eternity.

598
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,140
Especially early in the morning and towards evening,

599
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,140
when the distinction of sky and water becomes uncertain,

600
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,288
when the whole of space becomes opalescent, the sort

601
00:41:07,304 --> 00:41:11,356
of pearly lips luminous grey. And the rising or setting

602
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:14,560
moon, this straw yellow,

603
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,040
blessed with the white cries of gulls

604
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,612
and with the patterns of masts and ropes and boats at

605
00:41:23,636 --> 00:41:26,812
anchor, which put me in

606
00:41:26,836 --> 00:41:29,320
mine with landfills gone that way,

607
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,680
and of all the voyages of which one is dream.

608
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,540
But under the surface of both sky and water,

609
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,220
there's the grim business.

610
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,780
Men and birds against fish, fish against fish,

611
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,762
the tortuous process of life continuing by

612
00:42:00,786 --> 00:42:03,830
the painful transformation of one form into another.

613
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:08,922
To preachers who don't anticipate and

614
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:12,250
reflect imaginatively upon this holocaust of

615
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:16,430
eating and being eaten, it's perhaps not so terrible.

616
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:20,474
But poor man skillful

617
00:42:20,522 --> 00:42:24,298
beyond all other animals. By being able to sink in

618
00:42:24,354 --> 00:42:28,468
time and knowing the future, he dies before

619
00:42:28,524 --> 00:42:32,116
he's dead. He shrinks from the shark's teeth before they bite

620
00:42:32,148 --> 00:42:35,556
him. He dreads

621
00:42:35,588 --> 00:42:39,204
the alien germ long, long before its banquet

622
00:42:39,252 --> 00:42:43,080
begins. Here is a Gull

623
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,320
that has picked a crab from a tide pool.

624
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,960
Sprawled now upon the sand, the crab

625
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,784
shrinks from the walls of its shell, resounding to

626
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:59,540
the tap, tap, tap of the gull's beak.

627
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,392
Who's that knocking at my door? I suppose the

628
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:06,980
shell of the crab, the clam or the muttle

629
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,460
is the boundary of its universe.

630
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,440
To put ourselves in their position, we should have to imagine a knocking sound,

631
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,270
louder and louder, that doesn't come from anywhere in particular

632
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:23,230
from the door or the walls or the ceiling or the floor.

633
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,670
Think of a knocking that comes from everywhere,

634
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:30,830
that beats against the boundaries of space and consciousness,

635
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:34,954
that comes as the intrusion of an utterly unknown

636
00:43:35,002 --> 00:43:37,990
dimension into our own familiar world.

637
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:41,350
Let me in. Let me in.

638
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:44,922
Surrender to this agony and you will be

639
00:43:44,946 --> 00:43:48,442
transformed into me. Dying to yourself.

640
00:43:48,506 --> 00:43:52,250
You will become alive as me. There's no way of getting

641
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:56,314
around it is that the gull isn't

642
00:43:56,362 --> 00:43:59,882
rapacious or greedy. It's just that he's being alive at

643
00:43:59,906 --> 00:44:02,510
all is the same thing as eating crabs.

644
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,800
Sea birds are transformations of fish. Men are transformations of

645
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:12,000
wheat, chickens and steers.

646
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,428
To object to this inseparability of pleasure and

647
00:44:18,484 --> 00:44:21,000
pain, life and death,

648
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:26,012
is simply to object to existence. But of course,

649
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:29,000
we cannot help objecting when the time comes.

650
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,880
Objecting to pain is pain,

651
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,040
so far as we know. The gull and the fish don't philosophize.

652
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:42,150
They enjoy life when they're eating it and hate it when being eaten.

653
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:46,562
They don't reflect upon the process as a whole and say how rough it

654
00:44:46,586 --> 00:44:49,906
is that we have to work so hard for a living. Or it's

655
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:52,790
just hell having to watch out all the time for those girls.

656
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:58,658
I'm sure that in their world this is something that just goes along with life,

657
00:44:58,714 --> 00:45:02,110
like having eyes or feet. But man,

658
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:06,010
with his astonishing ability to stand aside from him himself and think

659
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:09,434
about himself. In short, to comment

660
00:45:09,522 --> 00:45:13,402
on life. Man has done something which confuses his own

661
00:45:13,426 --> 00:45:15,150
existence down to its roots.

662
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:20,458
Perhaps the ghastly mistake was just that

663
00:45:20,514 --> 00:45:24,346
step in man's evolution which made it possible

664
00:45:24,418 --> 00:45:28,190
for him to comment, to reflect upon life as a whole.

665
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:33,390
In being able to stand aside from life and think

666
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,750
about it, he put himself outside it and found

667
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:37,730
it alien.

668
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:44,030
Perhaps thinking about the world and objecting to

669
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:48,370
its whole principle are simply two aspects of the same mechanism.

670
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:53,502
But aren't there also times when we

671
00:45:53,526 --> 00:45:57,170
speak of something that we know as a subject,

672
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,180
the subject of this book, the subject I am now studying?

673
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,304
Would it be possible to subject to life instead of objecting

674
00:46:05,352 --> 00:46:08,584
to it? Now,

675
00:46:08,592 --> 00:46:11,416
if the Gals and the fish don't philosophize.

676
00:46:11,608 --> 00:46:15,368
They have no consciousness of life being either good as a whole or bad

677
00:46:15,424 --> 00:46:19,176
as a whole. So when we philosophize

678
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:23,060
and pity the poor fish, that's just our problem.

679
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:25,450
From its own standpoint,

680
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:31,030
the world of animals and insects doesn't find itself

681
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,450
problematic at all.

682
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:38,130
There's not the slightest evidence to suggest it.

683
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:42,810
I'm quite sure they don't lecture each other about their duties.

684
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,250
Or worry about where they're going when they're dead.

685
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:50,854
Isn't it then, rather an enormous

686
00:46:50,902 --> 00:46:54,310
relief for us men to see that the

687
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:57,370
plant and animal world is no problem to itself.

688
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:01,686
And that we are wasting intellectual energy in making

689
00:47:01,758 --> 00:47:05,302
moral judgments about it? We seem

690
00:47:05,326 --> 00:47:08,694
to feel that the thing which

691
00:47:08,782 --> 00:47:12,890
knows, that it knows is one's essential self.

692
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:17,498
Our personal identity is

693
00:47:17,554 --> 00:47:20,910
entirely on the side of the commentator.

694
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:26,794
I think our difficulty is that our consciousness

695
00:47:26,842 --> 00:47:30,682
is too superficial. As if all our sensation were

696
00:47:30,706 --> 00:47:33,470
in the tips of the fingers and not in the palm.

697
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:38,442
Are we misled by the fact that we move freely on

698
00:47:38,466 --> 00:47:42,042
the earth. And aren't rooted to it in the

699
00:47:42,066 --> 00:47:45,180
same way as trees to the ground, ground and fingers to the hand?

700
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,616
Now we know that the atom, molecule,

701
00:47:49,728 --> 00:47:53,472
cell of any particular organism is what it

702
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:56,960
is by virtue of its place and

703
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,180
its membership in the pattern of the whole.

704
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,180
So I think this is why I love the ocean.

705
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,010
It's the most difficult part

706
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:14,870
of nature to mess up with

707
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,270
emblems,

708
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:22,350
symptoms of man's dissociated consciousness.

709
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:27,050
It's an environment in

710
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:29,870
which the awareness of our roots can awaken.

711
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:35,050
In which space, so real because

712
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:39,162
of the light and picture color, can be seen to

713
00:48:39,186 --> 00:48:41,950
be joining things instead of separating.

714
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:46,330
And I've just discovered that that

715
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:49,470
knocking on the wall of space and consciousness.

716
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:54,590
Was my own feeling.

717
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:27,810
Sa foreign.

718
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:36,358
Let's consider the power of holding your deepest aspirations close

719
00:49:36,414 --> 00:49:39,782
to your heart. There's something almost sacred in

720
00:49:39,806 --> 00:49:43,286
the things we dream of and long for. Aspirations aren't

721
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:46,790
just wishes. They're reflections of the core of who we are and who

722
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:50,454
we yearn to be. They're not defined by anyone else's

723
00:49:50,502 --> 00:49:54,448
vision of success or happiness. They are intimate parts

724
00:49:54,464 --> 00:49:58,512
of our inner worlds. Shaped by our unique experiences,

725
00:49:58,656 --> 00:50:01,540
values and the depths of our imagination.

726
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,592
When you keep those aspirations protected, you create a

727
00:50:06,616 --> 00:50:10,192
space that is entirely yours, untouched by

728
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:14,256
the expectations or judgments of others. This isn't

729
00:50:14,288 --> 00:50:17,648
about secrecy. It's about preserving the purity of something

730
00:50:17,704 --> 00:50:19,180
that's deeply personal.

731
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:23,882
Imagine a delicate plant that needs the right conditions

732
00:50:23,946 --> 00:50:27,258
to grow. Too much exposure, too much handling.

733
00:50:27,434 --> 00:50:29,070
And it doesn't thrive.

734
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:33,946
Similarly, sharing our dreams too openly can sometimes expose

735
00:50:33,978 --> 00:50:38,030
them to influences that pull us away from their true essence.

736
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:43,130
Sometimes, well meaning people can't help but impose their own fears

737
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:46,000
or limitations onto what you're trying to create.

738
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,860
Maybe they don't see your vision as clearly as you do.

739
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:54,228
Or perhaps they don't understand the journey you're on. They might

740
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:57,412
suggest safer routes, smaller goals,

741
00:50:57,476 --> 00:51:01,092
or more predictable outcomes because they're looking at it through their own

742
00:51:01,116 --> 00:51:05,412
lens, not yours. Their input, though often loving,

743
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:08,836
can create clouds around your vision, making it

744
00:51:08,908 --> 00:51:11,620
harder for you to see where you truly want to go.

745
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,360
There's a delicate strength in letting your aspirations live in this

746
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,392
quiet space within yourself. When you don't feel pressured to

747
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:24,472
explain them, defend them, or justify them, you have more freedom to

748
00:51:24,496 --> 00:51:28,040
explore them fully, to play with them, and to see where

749
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:32,072
they lead without interference. You are not constantly

750
00:51:32,136 --> 00:51:36,024
having to reframe your dreams to fit someone else's understanding

751
00:51:36,072 --> 00:51:39,750
in. Instead, you're creating them according to your own truth.

752
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:43,154
This inner freedom, this privacy,

753
00:51:43,282 --> 00:51:46,994
lets your aspirations grow more authentically without

754
00:51:47,082 --> 00:51:50,150
bending to outside opinions or expectations.

755
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:55,442
And here's another thing. There's incredible power in mystery when

756
00:51:55,466 --> 00:51:59,122
you keep a dream or goal private. It has room to develop and

757
00:51:59,146 --> 00:52:02,830
develop and evolve without the weight of outside science scrutiny.

758
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:06,970
You can experiment, make mistakes, and grow in ways that might

759
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:10,790
not make sense to others, but are perfectly right for you. Right for you?

760
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:14,986
By giving yourself this space, you're less likely to be swayed

761
00:52:15,018 --> 00:52:19,050
or discouraged by outside opinions because the dream belongs to

762
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:23,306
you, and only you fully understand its purpose and importance.

763
00:52:23,498 --> 00:52:27,034
It's like nurturing a hidden spark. You tend

764
00:52:27,082 --> 00:52:30,314
to it carefully, knowing that in time, it will become a fire

765
00:52:30,402 --> 00:52:34,442
all its own, bright enough to stand on its own without anyone else's

766
00:52:34,506 --> 00:52:38,666
validation. By keeping your aspirations

767
00:52:38,778 --> 00:52:42,470
close, you're also choosing where to invest your energy.

768
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:47,242
Sometimes the act of explaining your dreams or defending them

769
00:52:47,266 --> 00:52:50,906
to others can drain you. This energy is better

770
00:52:50,978 --> 00:52:54,026
spent fueling the journey itself, taking steps,

771
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:56,520
learning, adjusting and growing.

772
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:00,468
Imagine carrying a precious treasure. You wouldn't stop every

773
00:53:00,524 --> 00:53:03,880
few steps to show it off. You'd keep moving,

774
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:08,004
focused on the journey itself, knowing that you're headed

775
00:53:08,052 --> 00:53:11,268
somewhere significant. By holding back

776
00:53:11,324 --> 00:53:14,292
from sharing, you keep your energy intact,

777
00:53:14,436 --> 00:53:16,640
fully available for the road ahead.

778
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:21,738
And perhaps most importantly, by holding your aspirations close,

779
00:53:21,874 --> 00:53:24,510
you give yourself the gift of adaptability.

780
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:28,810
If you share a dream too early, it can start to feel set

781
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:32,870
in stone, almost as though you're locked into that version of it.

782
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:36,618
But when it's just between you and yourself, it can shift and

783
00:53:36,674 --> 00:53:40,170
Change, you are free to adjust it as you learn more

784
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:43,626
about yourself, as you encounter new experiences,

785
00:53:43,738 --> 00:53:47,508
as you discover new possibilities. This flexibility

786
00:53:47,604 --> 00:53:51,908
is essential because life is constantly evolving and so are we.

787
00:53:52,044 --> 00:53:55,620
What felt right at one point may need adjustment as we grow and

788
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:59,348
change. And by keeping your aspirations close, you allow

789
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:03,400
them to be living, breathing things rather than fixed destinations.

790
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:08,388
In this way, your aspirations become a source of strength,

791
00:54:08,564 --> 00:54:12,010
A quiet but powerful force that guides you forward.

792
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:16,010
They're like a compass, one that points you toward your true north.

793
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:20,782
And every time you make a choice that honors that inner direction,

794
00:54:20,926 --> 00:54:24,574
that supports that quiet dream, you're reinforcing

795
00:54:24,622 --> 00:54:27,410
a foundation of trust within yourself.

796
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:32,010
You're saying, I trust myself to know what's right for me.

797
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:36,398
I trust myself to go at my own pace, to make my own decisions,

798
00:54:36,494 --> 00:54:39,680
and to create a path that true to who I am.

799
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:44,280
Keeping your aspirations private isn't about isolation.

800
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:48,196
It's about nurturing a sense of independence and inner

801
00:54:48,228 --> 00:54:51,160
peace that doesn't rely on external approval.

802
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,996
When the time comes and you feel ready to share,

803
00:54:55,148 --> 00:54:58,852
your aspirations will be so deeply rooted that they won't be

804
00:54:58,876 --> 00:55:01,320
easily shaken by the winds of opinion.

805
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:05,680
There'll be a part of you fully formed, able to

806
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,088
stand strong in the light of day. But until then,

807
00:55:09,144 --> 00:55:13,520
you hold them close, allowing them the space to grow and unfold naturally,

808
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,420
free from the weight of others expectations.

809
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,248
In the end, the choice to keep our deepest aspirations

810
00:55:21,344 --> 00:55:25,392
close is a choice to honor ourselves, to cultivate a

811
00:55:25,416 --> 00:55:29,120
life guided by inner truth. It's a reminder that

812
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:33,366
not everything has to be shared to be real or validated, to be worthy.

813
00:55:33,558 --> 00:55:37,930
Sometimes the most powerful journeys are the ones we take quietly,

814
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:41,970
with a sense of reverence for the unique path we're on.

815
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:46,070
And when we allow ourselves this space, we come to realize that

816
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:50,150
our dreams are not defined by others perceptions or expectations.

817
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:55,190
They are shaped by our own courage, commitment and

818
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:58,598
clarity. So hold your dreams close.

819
00:55:58,654 --> 00:56:02,472
Let them grow undisturbed. When the time comes, they'll be

820
00:56:02,496 --> 00:56:06,056
ready to shine in a way that is authentic and unshakable.

821
00:56:06,248 --> 00:56:09,720
Until then, keep nurturing that spark, knowing that you

822
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,192
are on a path of your own making. One that will lead

823
00:56:13,216 --> 00:56:15,460
you exactly where you're meant to go.

824
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,328
Let's talk about the value of keeping some of our vulnerabilities

825
00:56:20,424 --> 00:56:23,928
to ourselves. Now when I say vulnerabilities,

826
00:56:24,024 --> 00:56:27,924
I don't mean hiding away parts of who we are or pretending

827
00:56:27,972 --> 00:56:29,680
that we're something we're not.

828
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,428
Vulnerabilities are the tender places within us,

829
00:56:33,484 --> 00:56:37,300
the parts of ourselves that are sensitive to the world and because

830
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:40,852
of that, they deserve care, attention. These are

831
00:56:40,876 --> 00:56:44,612
the things that might evoke a strong emotional reaction if exposed

832
00:56:44,676 --> 00:56:48,120
too openly. Our doubts, our fears, our uncertainties.

833
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,244
These are the parts that, when shared too freely,

834
00:56:52,372 --> 00:56:57,040
can sometimes lead to misunderstandings, misjudgment, or even misuse.

835
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:02,120
We live in a world that tells us to share, to be open,

836
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,676
to let others in. And in many ways,

837
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:09,852
that's a beautiful thing. Connection and openness are

838
00:57:09,876 --> 00:57:13,820
what make us human. But there's also a quiet wisdom in

839
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:17,676
understanding that not everything within us needs to be put on display,

840
00:57:17,788 --> 00:57:21,280
that some things are more precious when kept within a sacred,

841
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:24,350
private space. Our vulnerabilities,

842
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:28,430
in particular, benefit from this kind of protection.

843
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:32,410
Not because we're ashamed of them, but because they are still

844
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:35,350
in the process of being understood by us.

845
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:39,962
You see, there's a period in which our vulnerabilities need to

846
00:57:39,986 --> 00:57:43,450
mature, in which we need to fully understand them

847
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:47,470
before we can reveal them to the world in a way that's constructive,

848
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:52,930
rather than exposing them in a way that leaves us feeling shaken or uncertain.

849
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:57,550
It's a bit like tending a young plant when

850
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:01,182
it's still delicate. It needs shelter and protection, a safe

851
00:58:01,246 --> 00:58:05,134
place to grow stronger roots. If we take that plant

852
00:58:05,182 --> 00:58:08,494
and expose it to harsh winds and conditions too soon,

853
00:58:08,662 --> 00:58:11,998
it might not survive. In the same

854
00:58:12,054 --> 00:58:15,528
way, exposing our vulnerabilities too early

855
00:58:15,584 --> 00:58:19,528
or too openly can leave us feeling more fragile,

856
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:23,528
less sure of ourselves, as though we've given away a part of our

857
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:26,900
foundation before it was strong enough to stand on its own.

858
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,072
Now, when we hold certain vulnerabilities close, we're creating a

859
00:58:32,096 --> 00:58:35,592
kind of inner sanctuary. A place where we can process,

860
00:58:35,696 --> 00:58:38,898
reflect and understand ourselves. We give ourselves

861
00:58:39,024 --> 00:58:42,686
chance to sit with those parts of ourselves, to explore them

862
00:58:42,758 --> 00:58:46,290
without needing to explain or justify them to anyone else.

863
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:50,398
It's in this quiet space that we begin to understand what

864
00:58:50,454 --> 00:58:53,758
those vulnerabilities mean to us. Where they come

865
00:58:53,814 --> 00:58:56,890
from and how they shape us.

866
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:01,246
Are they reflections of past wounds? Or perhaps of a longing

867
00:59:01,278 --> 00:59:04,382
we haven't fully embraced? When we take the

868
00:59:04,406 --> 00:59:08,004
time to sit with our vulnerabilities, they begin to reveal

869
00:59:08,052 --> 00:59:11,700
their true nature. And we come to see them not as

870
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:15,572
weaknesses, but as sources of strength. As parts of

871
00:59:15,596 --> 00:59:18,836
our humanity that connect us to others on a deeper

872
00:59:18,868 --> 00:59:22,036
level. The irony, of course,

873
00:59:22,108 --> 00:59:25,108
is that when we keep our vulnerabilities close,

874
00:59:25,244 --> 00:59:29,520
we often strengthen our connections with others rather than weakening them.

875
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:34,776
When we don't feel the need to share every tender part of our ourselves immediately,

876
00:59:34,888 --> 00:59:37,820
we create a foundation of inner confidence.

877
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:42,296
And that confidence allows us to engage with others more freely

878
00:59:42,408 --> 00:59:45,416
without seeking validation or reassurance.

879
00:59:45,608 --> 00:59:49,432
We are not looking to others to make us feel whole, because we

880
00:59:49,456 --> 00:59:53,048
are doing the work within ourselves, holding space for our own

881
00:59:53,104 --> 00:59:56,424
growth, our own understanding. This self

882
00:59:56,472 --> 01:00:00,110
reliance doesn't mean we are isolated or, or closed off.

883
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:03,682
It simply means that we're able to engage with others from a

884
01:00:03,706 --> 01:00:06,150
place of wholeness, of quiet strength.

885
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:10,770
There's also a kind of peace that comes with knowing that some things

886
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:14,242
are ours alone. When we accept that we don't have

887
01:00:14,266 --> 01:00:17,954
to reveal everything about ourselves, we experience a freedom

888
01:00:18,002 --> 01:00:21,122
from the pressure to perform, to seek approval,

889
01:00:21,266 --> 01:00:24,590
to seek approval, to scow a version of our.

890
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:29,430
And when we have strong boundaries, we're able to offer more of ourselves,

891
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:32,934
more of our presence to the world. Because we're not giving

892
01:00:32,982 --> 01:00:36,570
away our essence in ways that leave us feeling depleted.

893
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:41,382
Over time, as our understanding of our vulnerabilities deepens,

894
01:00:41,446 --> 01:00:45,142
we may choose to share them. But by then, they're no longer

895
01:00:45,206 --> 01:00:49,046
fragile parts of us. They're integrated aspects

896
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:53,770
of our experience, parts of our story that we share with strength and clarity.

897
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:57,862
We're no longer sharing from a place of needing reassurance.

898
01:00:57,926 --> 01:01:01,622
Instead, we're sharing as a gift, an offering that

899
01:01:01,646 --> 01:01:04,730
may resonate with others and invite connection.

900
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:08,758
But until that time, we nurture our vulnerabilities,

901
01:01:08,934 --> 01:01:12,582
knowing that they don't need to be seen to be real. They don't need to

902
01:01:12,606 --> 01:01:16,310
be spoken to be valuable. They simply need our care

903
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:20,496
and understanding. So let your vulnerabilities

904
01:01:20,608 --> 01:01:24,112
remain close. Keep them as quiet guides, as companions on

905
01:01:24,136 --> 01:01:27,360
your journey. Know that they are precious not

906
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:31,040
because they're hidden, but because they remind you of

907
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,512
your humanity. They remind you that you're on

908
01:01:34,536 --> 01:01:38,144
a path of self discovery, one that honors

909
01:01:38,192 --> 01:01:40,820
both your strengths and your tender places.

910
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,968
And as you walk this path, remember. Remember that your vulnerabilities

911
01:01:45,064 --> 01:01:48,904
are not weaknesses to be fixed. They are pieces of your wholeness,

912
01:01:49,032 --> 01:01:52,360
Parts of the beautiful intricate mosaic that makes

913
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,552
you who you are in the end. By holding

914
01:01:56,616 --> 01:02:00,264
space for our own vulnerabilities, we give ourselves a gift

915
01:02:00,392 --> 01:02:03,448
far greater than validation. We give

916
01:02:03,504 --> 01:02:06,808
ourselves the gift of self trust, of inner peace.

917
01:02:06,984 --> 01:02:10,990
We allow ourselves to be whole, complex and wonderfully human.

918
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:15,266
And that is a strength that needs no audience, no approval.

919
01:02:15,458 --> 01:02:19,026
It is simply enough. Let's take a moment

920
01:02:19,058 --> 01:02:23,122
to talk about intuition and instinct. Those deep, often quiet

921
01:02:23,186 --> 01:02:26,630
voices within us that don't speak in words, but are knowing.

922
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:31,634
Now, we might think that intuition is just about following a

923
01:02:31,642 --> 01:02:35,040
sudden hunch or listening to a gut feeling. And sometimes it.

924
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:39,160
It is. But it's also about something far subtler.

925
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:43,380
Intuition is the wisdom that arises from a place beyond the

926
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:46,600
mind, a place untouched by analysis or logic.

927
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:51,028
It's not about figuring things out. Rather, it's about recognizing what

928
01:02:51,084 --> 01:02:53,960
we know on a level that can't always be explained.

929
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:58,292
The difficulty for many of us is that we've been taught to

930
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:02,174
distrust this kind of knowing, to dismiss it as unreliable

931
01:03:02,222 --> 01:03:06,330
or even naive. We're trained, after all,

932
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:09,582
to live in a world that values evidence, logic,

933
01:03:09,646 --> 01:03:12,862
reasoning. And while these are useful tools,

934
01:03:12,926 --> 01:03:16,770
they're not the only tools we have. They're just louder.

935
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:20,050
They take up more space in our minds.

936
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:24,014
But there's a quiet strength in listening to what the heart or the gut

937
01:03:24,062 --> 01:03:28,380
tells us, in tuning into the messages that can only be felt, not explained.

938
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:33,176
Think about the times in your life when you just knew something was off

939
01:03:33,328 --> 01:03:37,656
or when you felt an unexplainable pull toward a certain direction.

940
01:03:37,848 --> 01:03:41,100
That's intuition. It doesn't ask for proof.

941
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,656
It simply tells us this is the way. The reason

942
01:03:45,728 --> 01:03:49,336
intuition is so often undervalued is that it doesn't

943
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:53,204
conform to our need for certainty. The mind craves

944
01:03:53,252 --> 01:03:56,804
answers, conclusions, a way to wrap everything up in a neat

945
01:03:56,852 --> 01:04:00,628
package. But intuition doesn't work like

946
01:04:00,684 --> 01:04:04,356
that. It speaks in shades, in impressions, in feelings

947
01:04:04,388 --> 01:04:07,812
that are often ambiguous. It's more like a compass

948
01:04:07,876 --> 01:04:11,604
than a map. It points us in a direction without showing

949
01:04:11,652 --> 01:04:15,188
us every step along the way. And that ambiguity,

950
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:19,590
that inability to know in a concrete sense, can be uncomfortable.

951
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:24,022
But life itself is full of uncertainty. In embracing

952
01:04:24,086 --> 01:04:27,238
our intuition, we're learning to navigate life without

953
01:04:27,294 --> 01:04:30,710
needing to control every outcome, to trust that even if

954
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:34,290
we don't have all the answers, we can still find our way.

955
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:38,970
Now, how does this connect to the idea of self reliance?

956
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:42,870
Well, when we lean on our intuition, we're practicing a

957
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:46,288
form of inner trust. We're telling ourselves, I don't

958
01:04:46,304 --> 01:04:49,220
need to look outside of myself for every answer.

959
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,816
There's something profoundly empowering in that.

960
01:04:52,968 --> 01:04:56,304
It means we're no longer waiting for external validation,

961
01:04:56,432 --> 01:04:59,500
for someone else to tell us that we're on the right track.

962
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,856
Instead, we turn inward, we listen, and we learn

963
01:05:03,888 --> 01:05:07,920
to rely on what we feel rather than on what we think we should

964
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,296
do. This shift from external guidance

965
01:05:11,328 --> 01:05:14,980
to inner trust is transformative. It's what allows us

966
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:18,308
to stand strong even when others around us

967
01:05:18,364 --> 01:05:22,436
might question or doubt our path. Because ultimately

968
01:05:22,468 --> 01:05:25,680
it's our path and only we can walk it.

969
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:30,820
When we talk about trusting intuition, it doesn't mean we reject rational

970
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,360
thought or dismiss the value of reason.

971
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:37,720
Intuition and logic can coexist beautifully.

972
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:40,990
Logic helps us navigate the physical,

973
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:44,602
tangible aspects of our lives, while intuition guides

974
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:48,106
us in a more subtle realm. It shows us things

975
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:51,770
logic cannot, like where our true passions lie or what might

976
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:54,362
bring us a sense of peace. Often,

977
01:05:54,466 --> 01:05:58,250
intuition is that feeling of resonance when something just feels right,

978
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:02,346
even if we can't explain why. It's an alignment,

979
01:06:02,538 --> 01:06:06,762
a moment when everything clicks into place and we recognize

980
01:06:06,826 --> 01:06:09,330
that we're exactly where we need need to be.

981
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:13,926
But here's the thing about intuition. It requires stillness

982
01:06:14,118 --> 01:06:17,862
In a world full of noise, distraction and constant information.

983
01:06:18,046 --> 01:06:21,770
Listening to that inner voice means quieting the outer voices.

984
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:26,470
It means creating space to feel and to listen deeply.

985
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:30,294
This is why so many of us struggle to connect with our intuition.

986
01:06:30,422 --> 01:06:34,172
We're simply too busy, too wrapped up in the daily hustle,

987
01:06:34,286 --> 01:06:37,600
to pause long enough to hear it. But if we

988
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:41,152
slow down, if we allow ourselves to rest in silence,

989
01:06:41,216 --> 01:06:44,576
we begin to notice a shift. The mind quiets,

990
01:06:44,608 --> 01:06:48,768
the heart opens, and that inner knowing begins to emerge.

991
01:06:48,944 --> 01:06:52,060
It's a gentle process, but a powerful one.

992
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:56,400
And with time, it becomes second nature, a reliable

993
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,100
companion guiding us through life's uncertainty.

994
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:04,514
Now let's address the fear that sometimes comes with trusting

995
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:08,050
our intuition. Many of us worry that if we follow our

996
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:12,130
instincts, we might make a mistake or that others might not understand our

997
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:15,970
choices. We think, what if I'm wrong? But intuition

998
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:19,426
isn't about being right or wrong. It's about aligning with what feels

999
01:07:19,458 --> 01:07:22,642
true for us in that moment. Even if it

1000
01:07:22,666 --> 01:07:25,470
leads us down a path that others don't understand.

1001
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:28,714
Or as it seems illogical to the outside world,

1002
01:07:28,802 --> 01:07:32,906
it's still our truth. And in following it, we're honoring

1003
01:07:32,938 --> 01:07:36,730
our own unique journey rather than conforming to

1004
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:38,670
someone else's expectations.

1005
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:44,030
In trusting intuition, we're cultivating a sense of resilience.

1006
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:47,562
We learn that we can face challenges without needing to

1007
01:07:47,586 --> 01:07:51,376
know every answer in advance. That we can embrace the unknown with

1008
01:07:51,418 --> 01:07:55,652
without fear. And in this trust, we find freedom.

1009
01:07:55,796 --> 01:07:59,560
We're no longer bound by the need for approval or certainty.

1010
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:03,892
We move forward with a quiet confidence, knowing that even

1011
01:08:03,916 --> 01:08:06,760
if we don't have a map, we have a compass.

1012
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:10,840
And that compass, that inner guidance, will never lead us astray.

1013
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:16,200
So as we go through life, let's learn to honor this part of ourselves.

1014
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:19,666
Let's give ourselves permission to feel, to trust,

1015
01:08:19,788 --> 01:08:23,410
and to follow what resonates with us on a deeper level.

1016
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:28,374
Let's remember that we carry within us a wisdom that transcends

1017
01:08:28,422 --> 01:08:31,450
words, one that doesn't need validation or proof.

1018
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:35,686
This is A wisdom that is uniquely ours, a quiet knowing

1019
01:08:35,718 --> 01:08:39,478
that is always there, ready to guide us. And in honoring

1020
01:08:39,494 --> 01:08:42,370
it, we honor the truest part of who we are.

1021
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:46,886
In the end, intuition is a gift. It's a reminder

1022
01:08:46,918 --> 01:08:50,918
that we are not just thinking beings, but feeling beings too.

1023
01:08:51,054 --> 01:08:55,130
We are whole, complex, capable of logic and mystery alike.

1024
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:59,126
So let's walk this path with our eyes open, our hearts

1025
01:08:59,158 --> 01:09:02,010
attuned, and our intuition as our guide.

1026
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:06,310
And remember, sometimes the greatest strength lies not

1027
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:09,958
in knowing every step, but in trusting the next

1028
01:09:10,014 --> 01:09:13,360
one. When we think about resilience,

1029
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:17,472
what often comes to mind is an image of stoic toughness and unyielding

1030
01:09:17,536 --> 01:09:21,700
strength that can weather any storm without bending or breaking.

1031
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:26,820
But true resilience isn't about being rigid. It's about being adaptable.

1032
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,800
It's the quality that allows us to bend with the wind,

1033
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:34,800
to shift and move with the challenges that life inevitably brings our

1034
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:38,601
way. To cultivate resilience,

1035
01:09:38,745 --> 01:09:42,029
we have to recognize that life is dynamic.

1036
01:09:42,689 --> 01:09:46,425
Everything around us is in constant motion, and nothing stays

1037
01:09:46,457 --> 01:09:50,169
the same for very long. When we try to hold

1038
01:09:50,209 --> 01:09:53,929
on tightly to things, to cling to the past or to resist change,

1039
01:09:54,049 --> 01:09:57,189
we're only fighting against the natural flow of life.

1040
01:09:57,729 --> 01:10:01,609
And that resistance becomes exhausting. It drains our energy and

1041
01:10:01,649 --> 01:10:05,978
leaves us feel. Feeling stuck and frustrated. Real resilience,

1042
01:10:06,074 --> 01:10:10,154
however, is like water. Water flows around obstacles,

1043
01:10:10,282 --> 01:10:13,994
changes its shape to fit its container, and is unafraid

1044
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:17,370
to transform itself in response to whatever lies in its

1045
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:20,810
path. So resilience is not a matter of

1046
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,790
puffing it out or forcing ourselves through pain.

1047
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:27,922
It's about developing the flexibility to respond to life in

1048
01:10:27,986 --> 01:10:31,602
a way that allows us to remain balanced and connected to ourselves,

1049
01:10:31,746 --> 01:10:35,442
no matter what is happening around us. This kind of

1050
01:10:35,466 --> 01:10:38,834
resilience requires a level of trust, a trust that whatever

1051
01:10:38,882 --> 01:10:42,626
comes our way is ultimately serving our growth, even if it's

1052
01:10:42,658 --> 01:10:44,710
difficult to see that in the moment.

1053
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:49,490
The way we build this resilience is through an acceptance of

1054
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:53,026
uncertainty. Now, I know that's not always easy.

1055
01:10:53,058 --> 01:10:56,816
As humans, we have a natural desire to seek control, to create

1056
01:10:56,888 --> 01:11:00,576
stability and credibility in our lives. But here's

1057
01:11:00,608 --> 01:11:04,624
the truth. The more we try to control everything, the less resilient

1058
01:11:04,672 --> 01:11:07,920
we actually become. Because life, in its

1059
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:11,860
essence, is uncontrollable. It's unpredictable,

1060
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,728
and our attempts to control it only create tension within

1061
01:11:15,784 --> 01:11:19,296
us, a resistance that makes us brittle and vulnerable

1062
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:21,780
when challenges inevitably, inevitably come.

1063
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,168
Imagine you're standing in the middle of a river and

1064
01:11:26,224 --> 01:11:30,344
the water is flowing around you. If you try to stand perfectly

1065
01:11:30,392 --> 01:11:33,720
still and resist the current, you'll find yourself struggling,

1066
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,304
even getting knocked over. But if you allow yourself

1067
01:11:37,352 --> 01:11:41,000
to move with the flow, you find balance. This is the heart

1068
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,740
of resilience, learning to flow with life rather than against it.

1069
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,582
In this way, resilience becomes less about enduring

1070
01:11:48,646 --> 01:11:52,214
and more about embracing. It's about trusting

1071
01:11:52,262 --> 01:11:55,894
that we can navigate whatever comes not by rigidly bracing

1072
01:11:55,942 --> 01:11:59,430
ourselves, but by learning to move with grace and ease through

1073
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:03,238
whatever life brings. A big part

1074
01:12:03,294 --> 01:12:06,598
of this resilience comes from understanding that our thoughts

1075
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:10,230
and emotions, while powerful, are not the entirety of

1076
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:13,776
who we are. Yes, we might feel fear,

1077
01:12:13,888 --> 01:12:17,168
disappointment, or frustration when

1078
01:12:17,224 --> 01:12:20,672
life doesn't go as planned. But those feelings

1079
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:24,432
are just passing experiences. They're like clouds

1080
01:12:24,496 --> 01:12:27,728
drifting across the sky here one moment and gone the next.

1081
01:12:27,864 --> 01:12:30,704
The problem is we often cling to those feelings,

1082
01:12:30,832 --> 01:12:34,192
letting them define us rather than recognizing them

1083
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:37,522
as temporary. We get swept up in our thoughts,

1084
01:12:37,536 --> 01:12:40,974
thoughts, allowing them to pull us in all directions instead

1085
01:12:41,022 --> 01:12:45,054
of seeing them as waves on the surface of the ocean, while our true

1086
01:12:45,102 --> 01:12:48,450
nature lies in the still, deep waters beneath.

1087
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:52,670
When we recognize that we are not our thoughts or our

1088
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:56,530
emotions, we begin to cultivate a deeper sense of inner peace.

1089
01:12:57,190 --> 01:13:00,894
We no longer feel the need to react to every little thing that happens.

1090
01:13:00,942 --> 01:13:04,904
We become less attached to outcomes and more present to what's happening

1091
01:13:04,952 --> 01:13:08,888
here and now. This presence, this groundedness,

1092
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:12,776
is the foundation of resilience. It's what allows

1093
01:13:12,808 --> 01:13:16,520
us to stay calm and centered, even in the face of

1094
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,552
uncertainty or difficulty. In cultivating

1095
01:13:20,616 --> 01:13:24,460
resilience, it's also helpful to develop a sense of perspective.

1096
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,152
Sometimes when we're faced with challenges, it can feel like

1097
01:13:28,176 --> 01:13:31,622
the whole world is crashing down around us. But if

1098
01:13:31,646 --> 01:13:34,950
we step back, even for a moment, we often find

1099
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:38,406
that the situation isn't as overwhelming as it seems.

1100
01:13:38,598 --> 01:13:42,134
It's just one chapter in the story of our lives, not the whole

1101
01:13:42,182 --> 01:13:45,526
story. This perspective allows us to approach

1102
01:13:45,598 --> 01:13:49,290
life with a sense of curiosity rather than fear.

1103
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:53,090
Instead of asking, why is this happening to me?

1104
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:56,740
We begin to ask, what can I learn from this? This.

1105
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,620
How can I grow through this experience?

1106
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:05,096
Resilience in this way becomes a process of transformation.

1107
01:14:05,288 --> 01:14:09,144
It's not about avoiding pain or difficulty. It's about using

1108
01:14:09,232 --> 01:14:12,660
those experiences as opportunities for growth.

1109
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:16,312
Just as fire refines gold, the challenges

1110
01:14:16,376 --> 01:14:19,960
we face refine us, stripping away the layers of fear,

1111
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:23,618
doubt and insecurity to reveal the strength and wisdom within

1112
01:14:23,674 --> 01:14:27,250
us. And the beauty of resilience is that each time

1113
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:30,258
we overcome a challenge, we grow stronger,

1114
01:14:30,354 --> 01:14:33,794
more capable, and more compassionate. We learn

1115
01:14:33,842 --> 01:14:37,362
to face life with an open heart, knowing that no

1116
01:14:37,386 --> 01:14:41,230
matter what happens, we have the inner resources to handle it.

1117
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:45,202
And so, as we move through life, we don't need to brace ourselves

1118
01:14:45,266 --> 01:14:48,550
against the world or harden our hearts to avoid pain.

1119
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:53,222
Instead, we can cultivate resilience by remaining open,

1120
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:57,382
by embracing change, by trusting in our ability to navigate the

1121
01:14:57,406 --> 01:15:00,742
unknown. This is the true strength of resilience.

1122
01:15:00,806 --> 01:15:04,502
It doesn't come from fighting against life, but from flowing with it,

1123
01:15:04,606 --> 01:15:07,718
from finding peace within ourselves, no matter what

1124
01:15:07,774 --> 01:15:11,622
storms may come. So remember

1125
01:15:11,686 --> 01:15:15,294
this resilience is not about avoiding the storm storms. It's about learning

1126
01:15:15,342 --> 01:15:18,830
to dance in the rain. When we cultivate resilience,

1127
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:23,214
we find a strength within us that is unshakable. A calm

1128
01:15:23,262 --> 01:15:27,102
that no storm can disturb. And in that calm,

1129
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:30,702
we find the freedom to live fully, to embrace

1130
01:15:30,766 --> 01:15:33,870
life in all its beauty and mystery, without fear.
