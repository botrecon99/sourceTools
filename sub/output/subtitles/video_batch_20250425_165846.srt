1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:45,182
Sa we

2
00:00:45,206 --> 00:00:48,686
get more real as we get smaller. You see,

3
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:52,170
that's simply saying that the smaller things are the more real things.

4
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,686
Well, that's a ridiculous argument, because you can play it exactly in the opposite direction.

5
00:00:56,798 --> 00:01:00,430
You can say, oh, no, no, no, no. Since all small things only

6
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,530
exist relatively, that is to say, in relation to each other.

7
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,410
The only real thing is the big thing.

8
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,550
So all those small particles are relatively unreal.

9
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,210
The only thing that is real is the whole universe,

10
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,330
and that's so big that nobody can conceive it.

11
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,780
So do you see? All philosophical argument is a

12
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,060
game playing with people, arguing with each other

13
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,852
in words, playing up and down the

14
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:34,960
scale of arguing as to which level

15
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,320
of bits,

16
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,692
collections of bits or bits whatsoever, which one

17
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:46,232
is real. I've noticed a

18
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:49,660
very funny thing in observing with my experiments with psychedelics,

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,928
that psychedelic conversations are

20
00:01:53,984 --> 00:01:57,480
absolutely perfect examples of what is going on and

21
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,740
always has been going on in philosophy.

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,744
People start talking with each other, having very animated

23
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:08,760
conversations about nothing at all except the processes of

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,386
grammar. In other words, let's imagine

25
00:02:12,418 --> 00:02:15,590
a conversation in which nothing specific is mentioned.

26
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,762
No proper names are used, no proper nouns,

27
00:02:19,826 --> 00:02:23,282
nothing is being referred to whatsoever. But all the

28
00:02:23,306 --> 00:02:27,266
words that indicate more or less dimensions

29
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:31,170
of quality, dimensions of quantity, all the operative

30
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,690
words say words like

31
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,666
to be, to grow,

32
00:02:37,818 --> 00:02:41,490
to diminish, to expand,

33
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,538
to contract. All these are operant words which

34
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:49,110
can be used with reference to all kinds of specifics.

35
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,986
But they get into conversations where all specifics are dropped

36
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:58,050
out and only operant words are used. And they dance with each

37
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,470
other by using these kinds of words.

38
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,270
And philosophers are doing exactly the same thing.

39
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,560
Philosophy is an intellectual dance of

40
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,920
a game that we play. Just like it might be Go, or it might be

41
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,920
chess or checkers or poker, where we take these abstractions,

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,888
the set of cards 52,

43
00:03:20,944 --> 00:03:25,580
to the deck, and we play numbers

44
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,168
and orders against each other. See,

45
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:33,260
well, philosophers do just the same thing in all their arguments.

46
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,830
And you say, well, isn't that kind of silly?

47
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,442
Well, maybe it isn't, because life

48
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:46,990
itself, biology, is the same thing.

49
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,258
We have all these species that eat each other and

50
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:55,602
come on in different shapes and different forms and so on.

51
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:59,084
And there's a contest going on all the time to prove

52
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:03,020
whether the cats are more powerful than the mice or the humans than the rats.

53
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,732
And this constant thing is going on. But it

54
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:10,332
is the same kind of bubbledy, bubbledy, bubble, only it

55
00:04:10,356 --> 00:04:13,600
takes instead of such a simple word as bubble,

56
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,080
which is a vibration in the air, it comes on as a mouse.

57
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,880
And a mouse is a very Complicated way of saying bubble.

58
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,112
And so in all this, you see when, when you get it, when you get

59
00:04:32,136 --> 00:04:34,140
a game going of this kind,

60
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,700
there comes the point of what you might call emotional investment.

61
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,960
When you feel that the outcome

62
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,820
of this particular feature in the game is urgent.

63
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,402
See, this matters and

64
00:04:55,426 --> 00:04:57,990
you do you see that that's what we mean by matter.

65
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,750
The word matter, meaning something substantial, something material,

66
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,230
also means important. It matters,

67
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,270
and it's up to you what you think matters.

68
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,846
We teach our children what matters,

69
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:23,654
what's important for them to learn, and we teach

70
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:27,250
them basically that it's important to live.

71
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,622
You must go on. That's terribly

72
00:05:33,686 --> 00:05:37,450
important. When you get a schizophrenic child or a Mongolian,

73
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,214
so called Mongolian idiot, these children don't

74
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:45,800
realize that it's important to go on and they don't give a damn.

75
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,804
And they are very happy. But from our point of view,

76
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,164
incompetent, unadapted to society,

77
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:57,940
useless because they don't understand why

78
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,812
it's necessary to go on living. They're just going to have a ball where they

79
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:05,380
are. And generally what we would say

80
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,400
goof off.

81
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,124
And in a way, every being in this world is torn

82
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:15,600
between going on and goofing off.

83
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,540
We feel that's, that's the basis of our distinction between work

84
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,140
and play. Play is everybody needs

85
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,372
some time to goof off, but they must go back

86
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:32,876
to work. Because you've got to farm and fish and manufacture

87
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:35,080
and produce so that you can go on.

88
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,400
But when you see you have this terrifying urgency to go on

89
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,550
and feel you must, this is, this is important, this matters.

90
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,130
We screen out of our consciousness the fact

91
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,630
that this is our own volition and our own game.

92
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,458
Because we are captivated by the

93
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:03,346
illusion of the necessity and the importance of going

94
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:06,786
on to keep other people going on,

95
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:10,280
to keep children going on. People keep this thing up.

96
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,756
And the difficulty is that as we become disturbed

97
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:21,244
and anxious about this, it's more difficult

98
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:25,244
to keep the game going in proportion

99
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:28,556
as we are frightfully concerned to survive. We start fighting

100
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:31,932
other people, we start clobbering our neighbors who

101
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:35,612
are stealing our crops. And whatever it is, all the

102
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:39,048
old fights start. And it is these fights which

103
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:42,312
more than anything else at the moment, you see

104
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,140
are endangering the entire human project,

105
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,536
but all based fundamentally on the illusion that it's utterly

106
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:52,300
important that we survive.

107
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,740
A little while before he died, Robert Oppenheimer said,

108
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,540
it is perfectly obvious that the whole world is going to hell,

109
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,550
it's going to blow up. There is no way,

110
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,890
no, that it can be stopped. Except that

111
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,150
we don't try to stop it happening.

112
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,002
Because you see the panic. What's going to happen if

113
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:25,250
this bomb goes off? See, this more than

114
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,230
anything else will make it go off.

115
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,582
Because it's like a person who's looking down over a precipice and

116
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:38,910
starts to get unreasonable. He's terrified to fall

117
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,206
over it. And therefore suddenly all the strength goes out of his fingers

118
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:45,610
and his legs get wobbly and he's ready to fall

119
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,690
simply because of his fear of falling.

120
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,710
But you see, in all this, what underlies is

121
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:02,930
the illusion that

122
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,910
I am going on, that I constitute

123
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,082
a real continuity from this moment to the

124
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:15,110
next moment, to the next moment to the next moment.

125
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,230
What are you afraid of losing when you die?

126
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,930
Why, all the capital you've acquired during

127
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,670
your life, the experiences, the friends,

128
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,430
the status,

129
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,030
the skills, everything that you remember

130
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,630
would be destroyed. Ordinarily, when you die,

131
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,710
that's what. In other words, we are afraid of losing the past.

132
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,592
Now, it's perfectly obvious to me that

133
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:54,780
when you die,

134
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,272
yes, everything that you've acquired as

135
00:09:59,296 --> 00:10:03,384
an individual and stored in your brain is dissolved

136
00:10:03,432 --> 00:10:07,016
and distributed. But at the same time

137
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:10,472
it is equally obvious that you are not going to.

138
00:10:10,656 --> 00:10:14,116
That when you die there won't be, following the moment

139
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:17,960
of death, everlasting nothingness.

140
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,588
That would be as ridiculous as to suppose that you went immediately to heaven

141
00:10:23,604 --> 00:10:25,320
and joined the saints and angels.

142
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,360
The point is that when you die,

143
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,260
you are always reborn de

144
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,490
novo. That is to say, just as you were before.

145
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,930
When you came into this world,

146
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,610
there gradually arose into being the sensation of I.

147
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,302
And it stays there a while, it goes through a development and then

148
00:10:54,326 --> 00:10:57,662
it drops off. But all the

149
00:10:57,686 --> 00:11:02,190
time, everywhere, there are other eyes starting up. See whether

150
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,200
they be human, animal, anything you like, there being other galaxies,

151
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:11,304
etc. Always they're starting up. Now you

152
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:14,100
would say, is there? No, there is no connection between them.

153
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,680
No, in the same way, there is no connection between the molecules in your

154
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,420
hand and yet you say it is a hand,

155
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,408
but if you look at it under a powerful enough microscope,

156
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:32,074
the molecules in your hand are miles apart and you

157
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:35,434
would say there's no connection between. What's the connection

158
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:38,538
between this galaxy and other galaxies? Well, we can't

159
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:42,554
see any connection. And yet there are gravitational swings

160
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:46,870
whereby they respond to each other and move in a certain collective order.

161
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,350
So in a very similar way,

162
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,710
the constant appearance of beings who feel that they are I

163
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:03,092
constitute a wave motion and

164
00:12:03,116 --> 00:12:06,200
they may be considered individually.

165
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,700
See, what we're doing in this. I'm not. Is not Setting down a doctrine,

166
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,000
but it is doing an exercise in perception.

167
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,348
You can see it either way. You can see yourself, in other words,

168
00:12:19,524 --> 00:12:21,600
as existing only now,

169
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,590
that's the only you there is. The alternative

170
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:30,734
to that logically, is to see yourself

171
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:31,610
as everything.

172
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,734
Either it must be that you exist.

173
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:46,290
Bingo. Like that. You're a point. Instant bong.

174
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,422
You know, if you go and the Fillmore auditorium and dance,

175
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:53,894
they turn on stroboscopic light going

176
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:57,222
very rapidly, brilliant light, on and off, on and off, on and off, on and

177
00:12:57,246 --> 00:12:59,942
off. And it seems that everybody is all the time going in and out of

178
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:00,730
existence.

179
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:09,846
Now, in a way that's a, a kind of exemplification

180
00:13:09,878 --> 00:13:13,302
of the truth that we are vibrations and that everything does go

181
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,500
on and off, on and off, on and off all the time.

182
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,640
So the only real thing is the moment of on where you are now.

183
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,984
Got it, lost it, got it, lost it, got it, lost it. See, that's the

184
00:13:23,992 --> 00:13:27,760
only thing that's real. That's one

185
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:36,080
pole. The other pole is the view that all

186
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,940
these on and offs, just like the molecules in your hand,

187
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,040
constitute a continuous reality.

188
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,292
But if you follow that line, you've got to add up not to just what

189
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:49,720
you are at this moment. You're going to add up to the whole universe

190
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,560
through the entire span of its existence in space and time.

191
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,720
Any middle position you take between these things is arbitrary.

192
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,172
Say, okay, I'm going to be so much. I'm going

193
00:14:05,196 --> 00:14:08,812
to call myself this particular human being who lives for such and such

194
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:09,560
a time.

195
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,844
Okay, that's the way you want to play the game, as the rules

196
00:14:16,892 --> 00:14:20,412
you've been told. And if you want to get attached to that

197
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:24,012
and hung up on that, you're going to say that matters. And so you

198
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:25,200
feel material.

199
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,720
And the Buddhist idea is simply saying,

200
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,614
don't get hung up on

201
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:40,662
a. What is called in Sanskrit drishti.

202
00:14:40,806 --> 00:14:42,690
Drishti means a view,

203
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,850
a particular way of looking at things.

204
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,462
You say, that's. I'm looking at it from this point of view. This is

205
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:56,310
the way it seems to me to be. And I'm going to stick for that.

206
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,952
I'm going to get hung up on that. That is the meaning of, of attachment.

207
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:04,368
So in, in Sanskrit, the word sakaya, drishti means

208
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:08,576
the view of separateness. The view

209
00:15:08,648 --> 00:15:12,512
that the, the separation of a certain

210
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:17,248
bundle of wiggles taken

211
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:21,180
out of the total wiggliness of all that there is, is me

212
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,760
and another bundle of wiggles is very definitely you. And to

213
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,024
get stuck on that, you see, and therefore to start a

214
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:32,352
fight about it. Therefore, to start crying and weeping and

215
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:35,984
gnashing of teeth, all about this thing being real.

216
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:39,680
See, that is what

217
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,216
these people are trying. All these Buddhist sages and Hindu

218
00:15:43,248 --> 00:15:46,500
sages get people off that hangar

219
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,564
and say, wake up, wake up, wake up. Don't you understand?

220
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:53,360
The whole thing's an illusion.

221
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,244
Not that this is a word, to put it down and say that it's horrible

222
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:05,052
or bad. If you could see that the whole thing is an

223
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:08,732
illusion, you'd be happy as a lark and life would be

224
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:12,492
lived much more joyously by everybody. We would dance

225
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:16,082
together and give things away and stop, stop fighting.

226
00:16:16,196 --> 00:16:19,590
If we really saw it was an illusion, we'd all be happy in our big

227
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,742
dream. But we are constantly saying to

228
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:26,438
ourselves and we are saying to our children, it's real, God damn

229
00:16:26,454 --> 00:16:29,622
it, it's real. And death is going to be awful and sickness is

230
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:32,566
going to be horrible. You see, it's real and you better watch out. See,

231
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:36,342
you can see people say to me, you can say as a philosopher that

232
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:39,446
all this thing is. You can talk this way because you're sitting in a comfortable

233
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:42,742
place, you've got plenty to eat, but you watch when the thing hits you,

234
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:44,530
you'll laugh the other side of your face.

235
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,902
Well, I don't give a damn when

236
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:55,810
it happens. It'll happen, but it's not happening now.

237
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,118
And what I'll do when it does happen is the sufficient unto

238
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:03,750
the day is the trouble thereof. As if you let

239
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:08,170
yourself be free to react as nature dictates. When catastrophe falls,

240
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,762
you'll be okay. But if you go

241
00:17:14,786 --> 00:17:18,830
through your whole life standing in a state of preparation for catastrophe,

242
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:23,270
and you know what's gonna happen,

243
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:30,042
you just torment yourself and get ulcers and

244
00:17:30,226 --> 00:17:33,786
rotting brain long before it's necessary

245
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:34,790
for that to happen.

246
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:31,586
And I let you know

247
00:18:31,658 --> 00:18:35,750
how. A moment

248
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,190
you wanna hold forever

249
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,990
in the palm of your hand,

250
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,430
only with you.

251
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,700
Why don't you really know what you want?

252
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,904
Two reasons that you don't really know what you want.

253
00:19:06,072 --> 00:19:08,300
Number one, you have it.

254
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,980
Number two,

255
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,980
you don't know yourself because you never can.

256
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,270
The Godhead is never an object of its own knowledge.

257
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,506
Just as a knife doesn't cut itself, fire doesn't burn itself,

258
00:19:30,618 --> 00:19:34,394
light doesn't illumine itself, it's always

259
00:19:34,482 --> 00:19:37,990
an endless mystery to itself. I don't know.

260
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,602
And this I don't know, uttered in the infinite

261
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:44,750
interior of the spirit.

262
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,340
This I don't know is

263
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,240
the same thing as I love. I let go.

264
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,040
I don't try to force or control.

265
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,760
It's the same thing as humility.

266
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,120
If you think that you understand Brahma,

267
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,956
you do not understand and you have yet

268
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:18,652
to be instructed. Further, if you know that you do

269
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:22,876
not understand, then you truly understand. For the Brahman

270
00:20:23,068 --> 00:20:26,300
is unknown to those who know it and known to those

271
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,480
who know it not.

272
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,360
And the principle is that

273
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,320
anytime you, as it were,

274
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,912
voluntarily let up control, in other words, cease to

275
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:47,480
cling to yourself. You have an access of

276
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,176
power because you're

277
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:56,200
wasting energy all the time in self defense trying

278
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,288
to manage things, trying to force things to conform to your will.

279
00:20:59,344 --> 00:21:02,740
The moment you stop doing that, that wasted energy is available.

280
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,690
And therefore you are in that sense having that energy available.

281
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,630
You are one with the divine principle, you have the energy.

282
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:16,150
When you're trying, however, you act as if you were God.

283
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,474
That is to say, you don't trust anybody and you're the dictator and you have

284
00:21:19,482 --> 00:21:22,898
to keep everybody in line. You lose the divine energy because

285
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:25,110
what you're doing is simply defending yourself.

286
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,430
So then the principle is the more you give it away,

287
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,886
the more it comes back. Now you see, I don't have the courage

288
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,290
to give it away. I'm afraid.

289
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:47,462
And you can only overcome that by realizing you

290
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:50,050
better give it away because there's no way holding on to it.

291
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:55,686
The meaning of the fact, you see that everything is dissolving constantly,

292
00:21:55,718 --> 00:21:59,820
that we're all falling apart, we're all in a process of constant death.

293
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,352
And that the worldly hope men set their hearts upon turns ashes or

294
00:22:04,376 --> 00:22:08,000
it prospers and likes snow upon the desert's dusty face lighting a little hour

295
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,380
or two is gone. You know all that Omar Khayyam jazz,

296
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,168
you know, the cloud capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,

297
00:22:17,264 --> 00:22:20,544
the great globe itself I all which it inherits shall dissolve

298
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:23,776
and like this insubstantial pageant faded, leave not a rack

299
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:27,638
behind. All falling apart. Everything is,

300
00:22:27,774 --> 00:22:31,398
that's the, the great assistance to you. The that

301
00:22:31,454 --> 00:22:35,910
that fact that everything is in decay is your helper that

302
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,350
is allowing you that you don't have to let

303
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,886
go because there's nothing

304
00:22:42,918 --> 00:22:46,902
to hold on to. It's achieved for

305
00:22:46,926 --> 00:22:49,530
you, in other words, by the process of nature.

306
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,180
So once you see that you just don't have a prayer,

307
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,888
it's all washed up and that you will

308
00:22:57,944 --> 00:22:59,820
vanish and leave not a rack behind.

309
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,740
And you really get with that.

310
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,940
Suddenly you find you have the power,

311
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,300
this enormous access of energy.

312
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,880
But it's not power that came to you because

313
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,910
you grabbed it came in entirely the opposite way.

314
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,346
The power that comes to you in an opposite way is

315
00:23:23,418 --> 00:23:27,110
power with which you can be trusted.

316
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,882
If any one of us could at

317
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:42,530
this moment be as one about to

318
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,404
die genuinely

319
00:23:46,452 --> 00:23:50,484
and honestly, we would understand

320
00:23:50,572 --> 00:23:51,840
the mystery of life.

321
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,400
Because death is the source of life.

322
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,220
Just as we see in nature. When the leaves fall from the trees,

323
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,636
they mold and rot. And this supplies humus from which more

324
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,840
plants can grow. It's a cycle, life.

325
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,840
But in every way, symbolic and otherwise, Human beings

326
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,820
try to stop that cycle. It is not,

327
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,132
therefore, natural for us to wish to

328
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:25,780
prolong life indefinitely. But we live

329
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,036
in a culture where it has been rubbed

330
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,252
into us in every conceivable way.

331
00:24:33,356 --> 00:24:35,440
That to die is a terrible thing.

332
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,854
And that is a tremendous disease from which our culture

333
00:24:41,902 --> 00:24:45,662
in particular suffers. And we notice it, firstly, in the way in

334
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:49,598
which death is swept under the carpet. When one

335
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:53,374
gets to an extreme, that is to say, to the point where you realize

336
00:24:53,422 --> 00:24:57,646
that there is nothing you can do about life, nothing you cannot

337
00:24:57,678 --> 00:25:00,970
do about life, Then you're the mosquito biting the iron ball.

338
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,804
Well, so in the same way he said, look, you heard

339
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:09,020
a bomb coming at you. You could hear it whistle. And you

340
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,220
knew it was right above you and headed straight at you and that you were

341
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,960
finished. And you accepted it.

342
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,540
And suddenly there was a strange

343
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,000
feeling that everything is absolutely clear.

344
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,628
You suddenly see that there isn't a grain of dust in the whole universe that's

345
00:25:27,644 --> 00:25:31,076
in the wrong place. That you understand completely,

346
00:25:31,188 --> 00:25:33,732
absolutely, totally what it's all about.

347
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:35,600
Because you can't say what it is.

348
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,636
So, you see, this is always the opportunity presented

349
00:25:41,668 --> 00:25:42,560
by death.

350
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,160
That if one can go into death with eyes open.

351
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,880
And have somebody help you if necessary,

352
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,640
to give up before you die,

353
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,620
this extraordinary thing can happen to you. So that

354
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,040
from your standpoint, in that position at that time,

355
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,980
you would say, I wouldn't have missed that opportunity for the

356
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,044
world. Now I understand why we die. The reason we die

357
00:26:18,092 --> 00:26:23,750
is to give us the opportunity to understand what life's all about by

358
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,542
letting go. Because then we come to a situation that the ego

359
00:26:27,606 --> 00:26:31,302
can't deal with. When we are no longer hypnotized

360
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:35,270
by that, Then our natural consciousness can see clearly

361
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,250
what all this universe is for.

362
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:44,090
So therefore, we have missed this golden opportunity

363
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,570
by institutionalizing death out of the way.

364
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:52,566
Instead of having a socially

365
00:26:52,758 --> 00:26:57,334
understood acceptance

366
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:02,182
of death and rejoicing in death to

367
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:03,090
be important.

368
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,182
Existence does not have to go on any longer than a

369
00:27:08,206 --> 00:27:12,230
moment. Quantitative continuity is of

370
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:15,696
no value. Who said you're supposed

371
00:27:15,728 --> 00:27:19,872
to survive? Who gave you the idea

372
00:27:20,016 --> 00:27:22,700
that it's a gas to go on and on and on?

373
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,728
And we can't say that it's a good thing for everything to go on living.

374
00:27:27,824 --> 00:27:31,216
From a very simple demonstration that if we enable everybody

375
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:34,580
to go on living, we overcrowd ourselves.

376
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,580
That we're like an unpruned tree.

377
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:45,530
We can also look further into it and see that

378
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:49,550
if our death could be indefinitely postponed,

379
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,350
we would not actually go on postponing it indefinitely.

380
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:02,810
Because after a certain point we would realize that

381
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,096
that isn't the way in which we want it to survive.

382
00:28:06,258 --> 00:28:08,160
Why else would we have children?

383
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,468
Because children arrange

384
00:28:14,564 --> 00:28:17,520
for us to survive in another way.

385
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:26,452
By, as it were, passing on a torch so

386
00:28:26,476 --> 00:28:30,260
that you don't have to carry it all the time. There comes

387
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,990
a point where you can give it up and say, now you

388
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:34,610
work.

389
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:42,710
It's a far more amusing arrangement for nature to

390
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:46,822
continue the process of life through different individuals than

391
00:28:46,846 --> 00:28:50,630
it is always with the same individual. Because as

392
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:54,570
each new individual approaches life, life is renewed.

393
00:28:56,030 --> 00:29:00,000
And one remembers how fascinating the most

394
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,380
ordinary, everyday things are to a child.

395
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,992
Because they see them all as marvelous. Because they see

396
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:10,900
them all in a way that is not related to survival and profit.

397
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:17,056
When we get to thinking of everything in terms of survival and profit value

398
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:21,472
as we do, then the

399
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:25,390
shapes of scratches on the floor cease to have magic.

400
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,710
And most things in fact, cease to have magic.

401
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:36,522
So therefore, in the course of nature, once we have

402
00:29:36,626 --> 00:29:40,714
ceased to see magic in the world anymore, we are no longer

403
00:29:40,842 --> 00:29:44,190
fulfilling nature's game of being aware of itself.

404
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:49,230
There's no point in it anymore. And so we die.

405
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,276
And so something else comes to birth which gets an entirely

406
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:57,356
new view. And so nature's self

407
00:29:57,388 --> 00:30:00,000
awareness is a game worth the candle.

408
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,640
So then, when there is nobody

409
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,382
left to resist the

410
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,930
thing that we call change, which is simply another word for life.

411
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:28,238
And when we dispel the illusion that

412
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:31,726
we think our thoughts instead

413
00:30:31,758 --> 00:30:35,902
of being just a stream of thoughts, and that we feel our

414
00:30:35,926 --> 00:30:38,130
feelings instead of being just feelings,

415
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,900
it's like saying, you know, to feel the feelings is

416
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,436
a redundant expression. It's like

417
00:30:47,508 --> 00:30:50,720
saying, actually I hear sounds.

418
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,920
For there are no sounds which are not heard.

419
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,480
Hearing is sound, seeing is sight.

420
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,524
You don't see sights. Sightseeing is a ridiculous

421
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:08,480
word. You could just say either sighting

422
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,900
or seeing one or the other. But sightseeing is nonsense.

423
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,820
So we keep the doubling our words. And this doubling

424
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,220
is comparable to oscillation

425
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,568
in an electrical system where there's

426
00:31:28,584 --> 00:31:32,824
too much feedback. Where you remember in the old fashioned telephone

427
00:31:32,952 --> 00:31:37,066
where the receiver was separate from the. From the mouthpiece,

428
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:40,970
the transmitter, if you wanted to annoy

429
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:44,474
someone who was abusing you on the telephone, you could make

430
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:48,010
them listen to themselves by putting the receiver to the mouthpiece.

431
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:51,978
But it actually didn't have that effect. It set up oscillation.

432
00:31:52,154 --> 00:31:56,510
It started to howl. It could be very, very hard on the ears.

433
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:02,560
The same way if you turn a television camera at

434
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,696
the monitor, that is to say the television set

435
00:32:05,768 --> 00:32:09,540
in the studio, the whole thing will start to jiggle.

436
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,872
The visual picture will be of oscillation like

437
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:20,592
that. And the same thing happens here when

438
00:32:20,616 --> 00:32:24,144
you get to think, that you

439
00:32:24,312 --> 00:32:25,940
think your thoughts,

440
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:33,018
the you standing aside the thoughts has

441
00:32:33,074 --> 00:32:35,790
the same sort of consequence as seeing double.

442
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:42,522
And then you think, can I observe the

443
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:44,910
thinker thinking the thoughts?

444
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,750
Or I am worried

445
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,350
and I ought not to worry.

446
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:59,970
But because I can't stop worrying, I'm worried because I worry.

447
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,606
And you see where that could lead to. It leads to exactly

448
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:07,890
the same situation

449
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:12,222
that happens in the telephone. And that is what we

450
00:33:12,246 --> 00:33:14,530
call anxiety trembling.

451
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,970
But this discipline that we're talking about of Nagajunus

452
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,366
abolishes anxiety because

453
00:33:28,438 --> 00:33:31,662
you discover that no amount of anxiety makes

454
00:33:31,686 --> 00:33:33,690
any difference to anything that's going to happen.

455
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,966
In other words, from the first standpoint,

456
00:33:41,998 --> 00:33:45,010
the worst is going to happen. You're all going to die.

457
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,216
And don't just put it off in the back of your mind and say,

458
00:33:50,288 --> 00:33:52,100
I'll consider that later.

459
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,568
It's the most important thing to consider now because

460
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:05,400
it enables you. It is the mercy of nature because

461
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,224
it's going to enable you to let go and not defend

462
00:34:09,272 --> 00:34:12,830
yourself all the time. Waste all energies inside

463
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,830
self defense.

464
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:21,090
So go and

465
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:24,498
not defend yourself all the time. Waste all

466
00:34:24,554 --> 00:34:26,230
energies in self defense.

467
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,680
Because he said every everything is Maya.

468
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,812
So the way it is being interpreted is Maya means it

469
00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:48,252
doesn't exist. Maya does not mean it

470
00:34:48,276 --> 00:34:51,564
does not exist. Maya means an illusion.

471
00:34:51,692 --> 00:34:55,000
Maya means you are not seeing it the way it is.

472
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,510
But you see, however much you mask it under

473
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,610
lofty ideals. I mean the

474
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:45,674
most religious people in the world, the greatest saints are the veriest

475
00:35:45,722 --> 00:35:48,858
rascals. I've known lots

476
00:35:48,874 --> 00:35:52,202
of them. I must tell you

477
00:35:52,226 --> 00:35:55,630
in confidence, I've known a lot of clergymen.

478
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,010
And the filthiest stories I have ever heard in my life were

479
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,870
told me by clergy clergyman.

480
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,522
So in Hebrew theology,

481
00:36:08,586 --> 00:36:11,882
incidentally, that there is a thing called the

482
00:36:11,906 --> 00:36:15,962
yetza hara. And in the beginning of time,

483
00:36:16,146 --> 00:36:19,882
when God created Adam, he implanted in

484
00:36:19,906 --> 00:36:23,402
him the yetzahara. And the yetzahara means the

485
00:36:23,426 --> 00:36:27,450
wayward spirit. He put something funny in

486
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:30,660
man so that man would be a little

487
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,148
odd. And it was the result of the yetza

488
00:36:34,164 --> 00:36:38,148
hara. That Adam was tempted by Eve,

489
00:36:38,244 --> 00:36:41,960
who was tempted by the serpent to eat that famous fruit.

490
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,700
And. But the Hebrew believes that everything that

491
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,640
God created is good, including the yetzahara.

492
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,602
Because if it hadn't been for the yetzer hara, there would have.

493
00:36:55,626 --> 00:36:58,882
Nothing ever happened. Everybody would

494
00:36:58,906 --> 00:37:02,550
have obeyed God and God would have said, well, this is kind of a bore

495
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,770
now. But you see, you can't. You can't just get up

496
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:16,050
to someone and say, disobey me. Because if

497
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:19,330
they do, they're obeying. You see,

498
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,234
that's a double bind. Say to somebody, disobey me.

499
00:37:22,322 --> 00:37:24,390
But God was much more subtle than that.

500
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:29,770
He didn't tell Adam to disobey him. He told him to obey.

501
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:33,450
But subtly, he put this yetza hara thing in like that,

502
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:36,910
so that God would say, well, I'm not responsible.

503
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:41,150
Well, this thing's going to happen on its own. Because what everybody wants

504
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:44,954
is something to happen on its own.

505
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:48,506
And everybody wants that because,

506
00:37:48,578 --> 00:37:51,990
you see the sensation of being you,

507
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:57,402
this curious, lonely center

508
00:37:57,466 --> 00:38:00,954
of awkward sensitivity, subject to the most peculiar

509
00:38:01,002 --> 00:38:04,230
feelings and pains and anxieties and all that sort of thing.

510
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:09,338
All that is

511
00:38:09,394 --> 00:38:13,098
an essential prerequisite for

512
00:38:13,154 --> 00:38:14,750
feeling something else.

513
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:23,530
These two experiences go together if

514
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:26,682
you want. In other words, if you want

515
00:38:26,706 --> 00:38:30,586
to be omnipotent and you want to live in a universe where nothing happens

516
00:38:30,618 --> 00:38:33,350
except what you. Exactly what you will to happen.

517
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:38,378
In other words, you say, I would like to be God. If you think that's

518
00:38:38,394 --> 00:38:41,858
the way God is. And everything is therefore totally under

519
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:45,874
my control. Everything is absolutely transparent

520
00:38:45,922 --> 00:38:49,474
to my intelligence. I have no problems. A lot of

521
00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:52,994
people coming on like they think they've attained this state, well, that's a

522
00:38:53,002 --> 00:38:58,018
lot of bunk. Nobody wants to be in that position because

523
00:38:58,074 --> 00:39:01,426
there wouldn't be anything to it. Because once

524
00:39:01,578 --> 00:39:05,480
everything is under your central control, not just

525
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,032
nothing is happening. It's a ball from beginning to

526
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:12,248
end. So what?

527
00:39:12,304 --> 00:39:15,880
Any one or any being whatsoever who has

528
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,256
a sense of centrality, who has a sense of selfhood, who has a sense

529
00:39:19,288 --> 00:39:23,176
of identity, that sense of identity is inseparable

530
00:39:23,288 --> 00:39:26,920
from something else going on that

531
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,140
is defined as not being me,

532
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,160
as not being under my control. And that may jump at any

533
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,930
time. It might even eat me.

534
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:45,262
So what I want you first of all to understand is

535
00:39:45,286 --> 00:39:48,862
that these two sensations, one of being the

536
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,970
lonely, central, sensitive, vulnerable self,

537
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:57,690
living in the midst of a world that feels other,

538
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,730
that is not under your control.

539
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:07,498
I want to try and show you that these two sensations are

540
00:40:07,554 --> 00:40:10,778
really one sensation, or rather two

541
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:14,650
aspects of one sensation. You couldn't have the one Experience

542
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,310
without the other experience.

543
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:24,138
Now this is a rather good thing to know because

544
00:40:24,194 --> 00:40:27,190
it means that you won't panic if you discover this.

545
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,728
People who suffer from chronic anxiety are

546
00:40:32,784 --> 00:40:36,120
always in doubt,

547
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,480
you see, about this relationship between what

548
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,780
I feel as myself and what I feel as something else.

549
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,840
Let's suppose you're anxious about your relationship with other

550
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,040
people. You walk into

551
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,500
a room like this restaurant here, and you sit

552
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,000
down at dinner and some stranger opposite to you,

553
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,440
you know nothing about the stranger and you begin,

554
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07,148
maybe you feel a little reluctant to open conversation.

555
00:41:07,324 --> 00:41:11,132
You don't know what kind of a. Whether this person is going to be sane

556
00:41:11,276 --> 00:41:14,844
or some kind of a crackpot or some kind of a

557
00:41:15,012 --> 00:41:18,360
awful stuffy square or you don't know what it is.

558
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,790
So you start fencing around a little. But you get

559
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:26,982
the feeling, you see, of now I better watch myself

560
00:41:27,046 --> 00:41:29,494
because I do, after all, want to make a good impression. I don't want to

561
00:41:29,502 --> 00:41:33,130
make an enemy. So you watch yourself.

562
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:37,990
And this

563
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,810
is a funny thing then begins called self consciousness.

564
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:48,136
And people say sort of to each other and usual

565
00:41:48,168 --> 00:41:50,580
way in which strangers come on.

566
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,144
And also

567
00:41:57,232 --> 00:42:00,920
there are there, there is involved in this encounter the

568
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,752
secret games that people are playing all the time to

569
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:08,340
defend themselves by putting other people down.

570
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:18,322
This is really a very wicked game. But every,

571
00:42:18,426 --> 00:42:21,810
you see, every, every living being, if the truth be

572
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:22,430
told,

573
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:30,466
is a manifestation of everything

574
00:42:30,538 --> 00:42:33,698
that there is in our, what is what we call

575
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:35,670
God in old fashioned language,

576
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,972
every human being is. And every one. As I

577
00:42:40,996 --> 00:42:45,132
look around, I can see every one of you as the divine

578
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:47,240
being coming at me in a different way.

579
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:55,628
Crazy. But the thing is that what we do

580
00:42:55,764 --> 00:43:00,200
is to try and prevent people from realizing that this is so

581
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:10,710
by pointing out them in the most subtle ways their limitations and

582
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:16,182
seeing if we can phase them put

583
00:43:16,206 --> 00:43:20,086
a person off a little bit, make them uncertain, make them unsteady.

584
00:43:20,278 --> 00:43:23,622
It's like all sorts of games you can play where if a

585
00:43:23,646 --> 00:43:27,446
person wavers, he loses. But people

586
00:43:27,518 --> 00:43:30,698
play that with each other all the time. And the reason

587
00:43:30,754 --> 00:43:34,522
they do it is not the reason they think it is that the

588
00:43:34,546 --> 00:43:38,314
gay. If everybody were perfectly clear that they were a manifestation of the divine

589
00:43:38,362 --> 00:43:40,630
being, nothing very much would happen.

590
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,746
But so as to keep everybody a little bit unclear about it,

591
00:43:46,818 --> 00:43:52,154
the whole thing bugs itself and

592
00:43:52,322 --> 00:43:56,052
creates these little doubts. So what we are beginning with is

593
00:43:56,076 --> 00:43:59,220
these little doubts, you see, these sensations of

594
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,480
blockage, of not

595
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,612
being very sure of yourself, but knowing very much indeed that you are yourself

596
00:44:06,676 --> 00:44:09,360
and that you're alone. And it's all up to you.

597
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,200
The terrible feeling of responsibility.

598
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,860
So. But what I'm trying to point out to you is if you intensify

599
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,312
that feeling and bring it to its highest pitch. You will

600
00:44:21,336 --> 00:44:24,576
immediately realize that you are aware of it

601
00:44:24,648 --> 00:44:28,064
only by virtue of the entire sensation

602
00:44:28,112 --> 00:44:31,696
of something else. Something defined as

603
00:44:31,768 --> 00:44:35,680
not you. So the feeling of not you and

604
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,740
the feeling of you are relative.

605
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,980
They go together. And you can't have the one without the other.

606
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,936
And if you can't have the one without the other, that means there's a secret

607
00:44:48,008 --> 00:44:51,072
conspiracy between the two. They are

608
00:44:51,096 --> 00:44:54,544
really the same, but pretending to be different. Because the

609
00:44:54,552 --> 00:44:57,940
whole idea is, if there wasn't a difference, you wouldn't know anything was happening.

610
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,568
I mean, if it was all the same. It's like that song of Bob Dylan's

611
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:07,740
which says something like.

612
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,920
Well, I'm just like a guy like you. I'm just like anybody else. No use

613
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,300
me talking to you, because you just like me.

614
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:25,210
So the whole point is then, if everybody of

615
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,762
us all were the same. And all shared the same ideas.

616
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:32,442
Exactly. And so on, there'd be no nothing to talk about, because everybody would

617
00:45:32,466 --> 00:45:36,670
be a bore. There'd be just yourself echoing

618
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:40,442
back at you, you see. And you'd feel like a madman in a

619
00:45:40,466 --> 00:45:44,314
hall of mirrors. Where everything you went there was just yourself,

620
00:45:44,362 --> 00:45:48,070
you see, in all directions, just you. Well, that's no fun.

621
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:54,682
But you may think that I'm speaking in favor of some

622
00:45:54,706 --> 00:45:58,186
kind of schizoid, pluralistic universe. No,

623
00:45:58,258 --> 00:46:03,066
the whole point is this. That difference and

624
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,870
every kind of variety of differentiation.

625
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,990
Is the way through which unity is discussed, discovered.

626
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:17,106
I mean, this business about Vi Lance is

627
00:46:17,258 --> 00:46:18,270
very important.

628
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:23,282
And the fact that men and women, for example, as a

629
00:46:23,306 --> 00:46:27,042
primordial kind of difference. Never can really understand

630
00:46:27,146 --> 00:46:30,354
each other Is tremendously

631
00:46:30,402 --> 00:46:31,110
exciting.

632
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:40,240
Because that. That's a way by which something happens.

633
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,400
If it makes a difference, then it's there.

634
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,516
If it doesn't make a difference, it doesn't matter. And what doesn't matter doesn't

635
00:46:49,548 --> 00:46:51,640
exist because it has no matter.

636
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,628
So however it is,

637
00:46:59,764 --> 00:47:01,600
wherever you notice a difference,

638
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:07,082
the difference has two sides. What it is

639
00:47:07,106 --> 00:47:11,470
and what it's not. And these two sides.

640
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:16,230
Since you can't have the one side without the other side, they're really one

641
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:20,190
because they go together inseparably.

642
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:25,370
So when you get this extreme sense of your own existence

643
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:28,974
as a rather painful fact.

644
00:47:29,142 --> 00:47:31,090
In the middle of everything else.

645
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:36,782
The everything else feeling and the you feeling

646
00:47:36,926 --> 00:47:40,250
are two poles of one and the same process.

647
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:44,062
So that the real you is what lies,

648
00:47:44,206 --> 00:47:47,470
as it were, between these poles.

649
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:50,010
And includes Both of them.

650
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,600
Now this is the fundamental principle of the whole

651
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,220
way in which ancient Chinese thought developed

652
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,580
the philosophy of the Yang and the Yin.

653
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,060
This is one of the oldest ideas in the universe.

654
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,552
I mean, no, that's a rather too big language on

655
00:48:14,576 --> 00:48:15,580
this planet.

656
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:22,946
And the, the philosophy which I shall have occasion

657
00:48:22,978 --> 00:48:26,178
to speak of a little bit more later, of the book of Changes,

658
00:48:26,354 --> 00:48:30,194
the Yi Jing is based entirely

659
00:48:30,242 --> 00:48:34,738
on this, that the

660
00:48:34,794 --> 00:48:37,954
universe is the interplay

661
00:48:38,002 --> 00:48:41,698
of difference. And the primordial difference is

662
00:48:41,754 --> 00:48:45,212
between up and down, back and

663
00:48:45,236 --> 00:48:48,780
front. Black and white is

664
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:52,700
and isn't male and female, positive and

665
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,800
negative. So the word yang in Chinese

666
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:01,500
means or refers

667
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:05,612
to the south side of a mountain which

668
00:49:05,636 --> 00:49:09,362
is the sunny side. The word yin

669
00:49:09,556 --> 00:49:13,170
refers to the north side of the mountain, which is the shady side.

670
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:17,638
Did you ever see a south sided mountain only with no north

671
00:49:17,694 --> 00:49:21,510
side or in it

672
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:25,286
may also yang may refer to the north bank of a river which

673
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:28,502
gets the sun and yin to the south bank of

674
00:49:28,526 --> 00:49:30,250
the river which gets the shade.

675
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:36,210
And so you will remember this.

676
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:43,130
And one half of course is colored dark

677
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:52,970
as it were two fishes interlocked

678
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:57,334
and they are chasing each other.

679
00:49:57,502 --> 00:50:00,790
They actually form, you see, more complicated

680
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:04,642
symbols in which they form a helix, this is

681
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:07,794
a helix. And the spiral nebulae

682
00:50:07,842 --> 00:50:10,994
are shaped this way in the form of a helix.

683
00:50:11,122 --> 00:50:14,990
And this is the position of man and woman making love.

684
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:19,362
Fundamentally where I'm trying

685
00:50:19,386 --> 00:50:22,882
to get inside you and you're trying to get inside me, and we're trying to

686
00:50:22,906 --> 00:50:25,682
get into the middle of each other, but there's somehow or other a difference and

687
00:50:25,706 --> 00:50:29,874
we can never quite get there. Just like

688
00:50:29,962 --> 00:50:32,562
if I want to see the back of my head, I can go round and

689
00:50:32,586 --> 00:50:35,854
round and I can chase it, but I never quite catch up with it.

690
00:50:36,022 --> 00:50:39,310
But that's what makes everything work. It is

691
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:42,970
said in the Vedanta sutras that

692
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:47,118
the Lord, the supreme knower of all things,

693
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:50,530
who is the knower in all of us, doesn't know itself.

694
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:54,734
In the same way that fire doesn't burn itself and a knife

695
00:50:54,782 --> 00:50:55,970
doesn't cut itself,

696
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,600
so nothing to God even you see, would be more

697
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,264
mysterious than God. Do you

698
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:09,752
know somehow how you surprise yourself, for example, when you feel your

699
00:51:09,776 --> 00:51:13,512
own pulse and you suddenly feel this life going on

700
00:51:13,536 --> 00:51:15,180
in you, which you're not willing.

701
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,312
Or there are all sorts of ways in which you can say you have the

702
00:51:20,336 --> 00:51:24,344
belly rumbles and you didn't intend to have the belly rumbles

703
00:51:24,392 --> 00:51:28,176
and suddenly it happens. Or you had hiccups and

704
00:51:28,248 --> 00:51:30,540
now are you having hiccups or not?

705
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,540
Is this something you're doing,

706
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,024
or is it merely something that's happening to you as if it was raining and

707
00:51:39,032 --> 00:51:40,700
the rain was happening to you?

708
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,380
This is a very debatable question. Consider breathing.

709
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,950
Are you breathing or is it breathing you?

710
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:57,626
Well, you can feel it either way. You can decide to breathe

711
00:51:57,658 --> 00:52:01,402
and feel that you're breathing in just the same way that you walk when

712
00:52:01,426 --> 00:52:05,194
you want to. On the other hand, when you forget about breathing

713
00:52:05,242 --> 00:52:08,826
altogether, it still goes on. And so it seems to be something that happens

714
00:52:08,858 --> 00:52:11,110
to you. Which is it?

715
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:16,042
Do you grow your hair, or does your hair just

716
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:19,972
grow by itself? What enables you to

717
00:52:19,996 --> 00:52:23,044
make a decision when you decide?

718
00:52:23,092 --> 00:52:26,884
Do you first decide to decide, or do you just decide

719
00:52:26,932 --> 00:52:29,684
now? How do you do that? Nobody knows.

720
00:52:29,812 --> 00:52:30,720
You see,

721
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:36,676
when J tells a story that one

722
00:52:36,828 --> 00:52:40,100
philosopher asked another, how can one get the dao,

723
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:43,760
which is the power of nature, so as to have it for one's own?

724
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:48,560
And the other philosopher answers,

725
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:55,388
your life is not your own. It is the delegated adaptability

726
00:52:55,484 --> 00:52:58,892
of dao. Your offspring are

727
00:52:58,916 --> 00:53:03,520
not your own. They are the outputs

728
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,040
of dao.

729
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:11,952
You move. You know not how. You are at rest,

730
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:15,780
you know not why. These are the operations

731
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,920
of dao, so how could you have it for your

732
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:20,540
own?

733
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:29,360
That's a funny thing. We can experience ourselves through

734
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,020
and through as something that just happens.

735
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:40,750
Look at it this way. If you feel your body, your skin,

736
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:42,790
the solidity of you,

737
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:47,990
and regard what marvelous eyes you have,

738
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:52,910
which are the power which generate

739
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:57,434
light and color out of all these electrical quanta in

740
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:01,348
the external world, and these

741
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:05,092
ears, these beautiful shells that you wear on

742
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:08,964
the side of your head with their little spiral

743
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:12,160
bones, the cochlea inside, you know all that.

744
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,560
But you feel, don't you don't feel responsible for it.

745
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:20,560
You don't know how it's made, if it is made.

746
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:27,360
But it's you. That's what you are.

747
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:31,410
That extraordinary pattern. Beautiful,

748
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:35,714
gorgeous, wonderful arabesque

749
00:54:35,762 --> 00:54:40,066
of tubes of bones and cartilage and myriads

750
00:54:40,098 --> 00:54:44,226
of interconnecting electronics and nervous systems

751
00:54:44,258 --> 00:54:46,750
and everything wonderful. See, but the point is,

752
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:52,430
most people don't own this.

753
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:56,042
They don't say, this is me. They say, well, it's some kind of

754
00:54:56,066 --> 00:54:59,594
very clever machine which the Lord God made out of his infinite

755
00:54:59,642 --> 00:55:01,990
wisdom and put me in it.

756
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:13,018
And this is a very limited view because

757
00:55:13,074 --> 00:55:18,170
the. The extraordinary thing is, you see that this

758
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:22,738
is you, this extraordinary,

759
00:55:22,834 --> 00:55:25,058
marvelous goings on,

760
00:55:25,194 --> 00:55:28,642
see? But you can feel it, all of it, as if

761
00:55:28,666 --> 00:55:32,226
it was just happening to you. But if you want to feel it that way,

762
00:55:32,298 --> 00:55:35,266
then you've got to go the whole way and you've got to feel that your

763
00:55:35,338 --> 00:55:37,310
decisions just happen to you.

764
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:43,138
And the thing that you call yourself to which things happen is

765
00:55:43,194 --> 00:55:46,460
just something that happens. See, you go,

766
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,532
you don't know how you manage to be an ego, how you happen to be

767
00:55:49,556 --> 00:55:52,040
conscious. That just happened too.

768
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:56,364
So happenings happen to a happening. So you

769
00:55:56,372 --> 00:56:00,040
can feel yourself completely irresponsible like that. See,

770
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:04,332
there's nowhere. Or when

771
00:56:04,356 --> 00:56:07,400
you get that way, that's a very interesting road to run.

772
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:12,076
But you can try the other way. You can extend

773
00:56:12,108 --> 00:56:15,018
it and say, now look here, if, if, if,

774
00:56:15,074 --> 00:56:19,930
if I really am my eyes and

775
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:23,258
I, although I don't understand them, I mean that is, say I can't describe

776
00:56:23,274 --> 00:56:25,630
it in lines, in words.

777
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:31,626
This is me. It's an extraordinary

778
00:56:31,658 --> 00:56:32,710
thing, but it is.

779
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:37,550
Well, I don't understand how it happens.

780
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:41,450
But then, you see, that's the whole point,

781
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:45,454
as I made a little while ago, that the very Lord God himself

782
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:48,730
doesn't understand how he happens. Because if he did,

783
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:53,262
what would be the point? There'd be no mystery, be no

784
00:56:53,286 --> 00:56:56,942
possibility of surprises. That's why there has

785
00:56:56,966 --> 00:57:00,574
to be Yang and Yin. Yang is bright and it understands

786
00:57:00,622 --> 00:57:03,890
everything. Yin is dark and damned if she'll be understood.

787
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:13,400
But there are two phases of the same being. So your Yang side

788
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:17,084
is your conscious attention. All the bright things you know and all the

789
00:57:17,092 --> 00:57:20,332
information you have and all the know how and that you know what to do.

790
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:24,236
And your Yin side is the other side of the Yang, which enables

791
00:57:24,268 --> 00:57:27,596
the Yang to function. Because you don't know why the Yang side of you functions,

792
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:31,340
that is the conscious, bright, intelligent side of you. It all depends on something

793
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,582
you don't understand at all. Because if it

794
00:57:34,606 --> 00:57:37,942
didn't, it wouldn't be there, just like you wouldn't be

795
00:57:37,966 --> 00:57:39,690
here unless there was something else.

796
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:45,170
So they move together.

797
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:51,670
And therefore, if you will accept the

798
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:55,450
idea that you are your own eyes

799
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:59,462
and your own heart and your own ears with

800
00:57:59,486 --> 00:58:02,770
that wonderful little spiral

801
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:07,166
cochlea inside and all these amazing gadgets

802
00:58:07,198 --> 00:58:09,530
here, you're all that,

803
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:13,690
but you don't anything about it, but you are it.

804
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:18,302
Now, therefore, by a little extension of the imagination, you can

805
00:58:18,326 --> 00:58:21,470
very well see that if all those bones and

806
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:25,490
subtleties inside you feel other than your conscious ego,

807
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,128
but nevertheless are one with it, the same

808
00:58:31,184 --> 00:58:35,220
argument will go for all the other things going on around you.

809
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,104
The sun shining, the stars twinkling, the wind blowing, and the

810
00:58:40,112 --> 00:58:43,900
great ocean restlessly pounding against these cliffs.

811
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,928
That's you too. You don't control it, of course,

812
00:58:47,984 --> 00:58:50,952
because there has to be something about you you don't control or you wouldn't be

813
00:58:50,976 --> 00:58:54,850
you. I see that

814
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:58,430
all. All that is lesson elementary in

815
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:02,950
relativity and relativity.

816
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:07,442
I've talked about it in this way, which is kind of unscholarly

817
00:59:07,506 --> 00:59:10,946
and so on, but I. I wanted to get the message

818
00:59:10,978 --> 00:59:15,298
across, the idea across, because to understand the

819
00:59:15,354 --> 00:59:18,860
principle of relativity is the

820
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:22,240
absolute foundation of the philosophy of the Dao.

821
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:27,372
Lao Tzu takes it up in his second chapter when

822
00:59:27,396 --> 00:59:31,260
he says, when all the world understands beauty to be beautiful, there is

823
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,924
already ugliness. When all the world understands

824
00:59:34,972 --> 00:59:37,520
goodness to be good, there is already evil.

825
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:42,172
Thus, to be and not to be arise

826
00:59:42,236 --> 00:59:46,034
mutually. High and low

827
00:59:46,202 --> 00:59:50,786
are posited mutually, long and short are

828
00:59:50,858 --> 00:59:54,146
compared mutually. And he goes through a whole

829
00:59:54,178 --> 00:59:58,270
list of opposites and show how they create each other.

830
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:02,066
It's like that wonderful

831
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:05,470
little parable. The Chinese character for man

832
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:08,190
looks more or less like an upturned V.

833
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:13,484
And Lafcadio Hearn, in one of his books, tells a story of a

834
01:00:13,492 --> 01:00:17,132
Japanese girl telling her little sister the

835
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:20,892
meaning of the character for man by taking two sticks of wood

836
01:00:21,036 --> 01:00:24,300
and balancing them together on the ground, two sticks of

837
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:28,604
firewood, so that they form the upturned V. And she says to her little sister,

838
01:00:28,732 --> 01:00:30,760
this is the character for man,

839
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:35,340
because neither stick will stand up

840
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:37,320
unless it has the other to help it.

841
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,920
And so, you know, we. We must dig

842
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,780
each other.

843
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:49,920
But the profounder meaning underneath this is

844
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:54,304
there's no self without other and

845
01:00:54,392 --> 01:00:57,632
no man. And don't forget, get back to the original point.

846
01:00:57,736 --> 01:01:01,536
Every creature in the world feels it's a man. I don't mean a male,

847
01:01:01,648 --> 01:01:05,210
but a human. And that is because it

848
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:08,362
is in this situation where the

849
01:01:08,386 --> 01:01:12,378
thing it feels as itself, as its separate identity is

850
01:01:12,434 --> 01:01:16,138
supported by the equal and opposite sensation of

851
01:01:16,194 --> 01:01:18,618
other, center,

852
01:01:18,794 --> 01:01:21,402
periphery, here,

853
01:01:21,586 --> 01:01:26,378
there, now, then is,

854
01:01:26,514 --> 01:01:30,516
isn't, or whatever these two

855
01:01:30,668 --> 01:01:33,908
are the yang and the yin, the two poles that hold

856
01:01:33,964 --> 01:01:37,332
each other up. So the

857
01:01:37,356 --> 01:01:41,364
Zen poem says, when misfortune

858
01:01:41,412 --> 01:01:45,204
comes, treat it as a blessing. When fortune

859
01:01:45,252 --> 01:01:47,640
comes, treat it as a disaster.
