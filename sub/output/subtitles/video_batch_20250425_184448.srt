1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,020
Now, existence, you see, is something that is spontaneous.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:11,208
The Chinese word for nature means

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,940
that which happens of itself.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,592
Your hair grows by itself, your heart beats by itself.

5
00:00:17,736 --> 00:00:21,896
You breathe pretty much by itself. Your glands secrete

6
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:25,256
their essences by themselves. You don't have

7
00:00:25,328 --> 00:00:28,962
voluntary control over these things. So we say it

8
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:32,402
happens spontaneously. So when you

9
00:00:32,426 --> 00:00:35,794
go to sleep and you try to go to sleep, you interfere with the spontaneous

10
00:00:35,842 --> 00:00:39,010
process of going to sleep. Try to breathe,

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,630
you know, real hard, and you find you get balled up in your breathing.

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,270
So if you.

13
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,674
You go to be human, you just have to trust yourself

14
00:00:52,722 --> 00:00:56,450
to have bowel movements and go to sleep. Sleep and digest your food.

15
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,850
Of course, if something goes seriously wrong and you need a surgeon, that's another matter.

16
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,366
But by and large, the healthy human being doesn't,

17
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:08,090
right from the start of life, need surgical interference,

18
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,970
and he lets it happen by him, by itself.

19
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,090
So. So with the whole picture that is fundamental to it,

20
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,010
you've got to let go and let it happen.

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,796
Because if you don't, you're going to be all clutched

22
00:01:24,828 --> 00:01:30,252
up. You're going to be constantly trying to

23
00:01:30,276 --> 00:01:34,332
do what can happen healthily

24
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:36,040
only if you don't try.

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,332
But we have a strange anxiety in us that if we

26
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:43,960
don't interfere, it won't happen.

27
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,680
And that's the root of an enormous amount of trouble.

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:04,240
But the basis of it all is this. Then if

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,940
we say, you must survive or I must survive,

30
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,460
life is earnest and I've got to go on,

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,440
then your life is a drag and

32
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,752
not a game. Now,

33
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:25,384
it's my contention, my personal opinion, this is my basic metaphysical

34
00:02:25,432 --> 00:02:29,224
axiom, shall we put it that way, that existence,

35
00:02:29,352 --> 00:02:33,180
the physical universe, is basically playful.

36
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,620
There is no necessity for it whatsoever.

37
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,700
It isn't going anywhere.

38
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,090
That is to say, it doesn't have

39
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,950
some destination that it ought to arrive at.

40
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,994
So then in music,

41
00:02:58,162 --> 00:03:01,770
though, one doesn't make the end of

42
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,970
a composition the

43
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,762
point of the competition, of the composition. If that was so, the best

44
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:11,150
conductors would be those who played fastest,

45
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,830
and there would be composers who wrote only finales.

46
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,698
People go to concert just to hear one crashing chord, because that's

47
00:03:23,714 --> 00:03:26,962
the end. Same way in

48
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:30,402
dancing, you don't aim at a particular spot in the room. That's where

49
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:33,830
you should arrive. The whole point of the dancing is the dance.

50
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,554
Now, but we don't see that as something

51
00:03:40,642 --> 00:03:43,950
brought by our education into our everyday conduct.

52
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,050
We've got a system of schooling which

53
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,070
gives a completely different impression.

54
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,674
It's all graded. And what we do is we put

55
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:59,802
the child into the corridor of this grade system

56
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,706
with a kind of come on, kitty, kitty, kitty. And now you go to kindergarten,

57
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:06,922
you know, and that's a great thing because when you finish that, you'll get

58
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,376
into first grade and then, come on, first grade

59
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:12,840
leads to second grade and so on. And then you get out of grade school,

60
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,584
you've got high school and it's revving up. The thing is coming. Then you're going

61
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:20,232
to go to college by Joe. Then you get into graduate school. And when

62
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:24,392
you're through with graduate school, you go out to join the world and

63
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:28,392
then you get into some racket where you're selling insurance and

64
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,880
they've got that quota to make and you're going to make that. And all

65
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,592
the time this thing is coming, it's coming, it's coming, that great thing,

66
00:04:35,696 --> 00:04:39,190
the success you're working for. Then when you wake up one day, about 40 years

67
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,850
old, you say, my God, I've arrived,

68
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,598
I'm there. And you don't feel very different from what you always

69
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:50,438
felt. And there's a slight letdown because you feel there's a hoax.

70
00:04:50,614 --> 00:04:53,398
And there was a hoax, a dreadful hoax.

71
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:57,142
They made you miss everything by expectation.

72
00:04:57,206 --> 00:05:01,174
Look at the people who live to retire. Put those savings

73
00:05:01,222 --> 00:05:05,078
away and then when they 65,

74
00:05:05,214 --> 00:05:08,970
they don't have any energy left, they're more or less impotent and

75
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:17,678
they go and rot in an old people's senior citizens community because

76
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,650
we've simply cheated ourselves the whole way down the line.

77
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,702
We thought of life by analogy with a journey,

78
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:30,030
with a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end.

79
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,302
And the thing was to get to that end, success or whatever it is,

80
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:35,530
or maybe heaven after you're dead.

81
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,526
But we missed the point. The whole way along it was a musical

82
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:45,078
thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being

83
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:45,730
played.

84
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,700
We see, don't we? All that we experience is

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,896
understandable as a spectrum of vibrations. There are different

86
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:10,592
kinds of spectra. There's the spectrum of light, there's the spectrum of sound.

87
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:13,460
We can also think of spectra of smells,

88
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,080
of tactile feelings, of emotions and

89
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,392
so on. All down the line. We are, as it were, living in the midst

90
00:06:21,456 --> 00:06:25,704
of a woven tapestry of many dimensions

91
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:29,768
in which the warps and the woofs are all these different spectra

92
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:33,912
of various kinds of vibrations. And as on

93
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,700
the loom, the warp crosses the woof.

94
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,992
And if you didn't have one, you wouldn't have the other.

95
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:43,020
It takes two to reveal the pattern.

96
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,008
So see yourselves as patterns

97
00:06:48,184 --> 00:06:49,780
in a weaving system.

98
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,956
You wouldn't Be here if it weren't for the interlocking of all these different

99
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:57,040
spectra dimensions.

100
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,680
So then here they go, and these things are vibrating.

101
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,172
Now, when it reaches a certain point, you say,

102
00:07:08,196 --> 00:07:11,452
oh, that's too much. When it reaches another point, you say,

103
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:14,908
it's not enough. Why, there's nothing here. I don't

104
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:17,850
feel a thing. Now I gotta go to sleep.

105
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,582
But on the other end, you say, no, no, no, no, you're going far

106
00:07:22,606 --> 00:07:25,610
enough. If you go any further, that's got to tear things apart.

107
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,050
I can't withhold this tension. See,

108
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,406
now. So some people will say, all right, now, now, relax, relax, relax,

109
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:41,926
take it easy, take it easy. But often, you see, the point is you can't

110
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:47,322
do that. So then what

111
00:07:47,346 --> 00:07:51,482
I would say to the person who cannot relax, I will stress

112
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:55,162
his tension, go the other way. In other

113
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:58,554
words, go with the line of least resistance. Say, okay, you're tense

114
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:00,670
about all this. Now, let's say really tense.

115
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,650
Let's scream, no, no, no, no, no. See,

116
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,282
you get violent inside. This is not to happen,

117
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:11,530
see? But so that one way or the other, you see,

118
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,890
it doesn't matter which you go, you begin to get into this

119
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,006
thing, which is what is happening when

120
00:08:19,078 --> 00:08:21,570
the boat of life begins really to rock,

121
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,370
yet rocking with it by whatever way is open.

122
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,530
But you are not going to force the issue here.

123
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,142
Instead of saying to you, you should be doing it another way than you're doing

124
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,582
it. I will be saying, now find out the way. You must do

125
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:44,141
it and

126
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:45,209
go that way.

127
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:53,021
Now, this is a general principle of

128
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:56,461
an art. And we will find there is a kind

129
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:59,901
of. There are limits to this art and how it

130
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:03,373
can be used and so forth. But once the general principles are

131
00:09:03,381 --> 00:09:05,849
clear, there aren't many serious problems left.

132
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,140
That if you begin to look at it in that way,

133
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,184
you will begin to realize that

134
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:19,580
ecstasy by one road or another is inevitable.

135
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,736
That indeed, ecstasy is, in a way, the nature of existence.

136
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:29,900
There is a universe for the simple reason that it's ecstatic.

137
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,460
What else is all this fireworks about?

138
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,800
It is just like music in this ecstatic thing going

139
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,464
off. And you have to be certainly

140
00:09:45,512 --> 00:09:49,144
careful in a little way here. That any initiation into a

141
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:52,820
deep wisdom is apt at first to demotivate you.

142
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,320
You think, what the hell am I doing? And all these projects,

143
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,584
building this up and that up. Or doing something to save the world and so

144
00:10:02,592 --> 00:10:06,420
on and so forth. Why, that whole thing is nonsense.

145
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,620
Yes.

146
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,896
See, our problem is we don't really know how to stop. We've got something

147
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:24,432
started and we see it's going in a wrong direction. And I think

148
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:28,060
the difficulty is to borrow an old Chinese saying

149
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,778
that when the wrong man uses the right means, the right means

150
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:35,930
work in the wrong way. In other words, there's something wrong with

151
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,922
the way we think. And while that is there,

152
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:42,330
everything we do will be a mess. Now, what is it

153
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,962
that's wrong? Now, as far as I can see,

154
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,482
the basic mistake is that

155
00:10:49,506 --> 00:10:53,466
we've invented this wonderful system of language and

156
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:57,000
calculation and

157
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,632
that it is at once too simple to

158
00:11:00,656 --> 00:11:02,740
deal with the complexity of the world.

159
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,736
And also, we are liable to confuse that system

160
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:11,112
of symbols with the world itself, just as we confuse,

161
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:14,536
say, money with wealth. A lot of people are in business

162
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:17,752
to make money instead of wealth. When they make the money, they don't know what

163
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:22,040
to do with it. And so, in the same way we

164
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,620
confuse happiness with status,

165
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,030
and we confuse ourselves as living organisms, which are

166
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,210
one with this whole universe, with something we call our personality.

167
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,490
Now, what is our personality?

168
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,730
Our personality is what we call our image,

169
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,478
our image of ourselves and also our thought about ourselves,

170
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:48,770
our idea of ourselves. This is the person,

171
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,048
in other words, what people meet and understand. And what I

172
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:57,180
understand as Alan Watts is a big act,

173
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,872
which is not really me. Because in

174
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:05,504
the image of Alan Watts, there are not all my unconscious

175
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:09,440
processes, both psychological and physical. The construction of

176
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,928
my brain is not contained in the concept Alan Watts.

177
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:17,032
And the concept Alan Watts does not contain the inseparable

178
00:12:17,096 --> 00:12:20,072
relationships which I have with all the rest of the universe.

179
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:22,780
And therefore, that concept is a fraud.

180
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,352
And when it's mistaken for the real me, there's a confusion.

181
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:31,560
Because if somebody says to me, alan Watts, do something

182
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,420
about it. The concept Alan Watts can't do anything,

183
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,860
in other words, because it's only a concept,

184
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,116
you can't make it lift a weight, just as three

185
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:46,716
is a concept. Three, the number. You can't make just plain three

186
00:12:46,788 --> 00:12:51,116
do anything. So also, you can't wrap up parcels with the equator.

187
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,480
It's a useful imaginary line, but it can't do anything.

188
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,260
But we all feel that this concept of ourselves, which we

189
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,340
call our personality or our ego, can do something because

190
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,240
we think it really exists. And I'll tell you why we think it exists.

191
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,912
What happens when you. If I were to say to you,

192
00:13:10,016 --> 00:13:13,380
now, look hard at the television screen, really look at it,

193
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,832
what do you do as distinct from just watching it in the ordinary way?

194
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:20,340
When you say, now, I really gotta see that, what do you do?

195
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,968
Notice that you tighten muscles all around here,

196
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,620
that you frown a little, you clench your teeth Perhaps.

197
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,060
Now, what has that got to do with seeing anything clearly?

198
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,422
Absolutely nothing to do with it. Same thing when you listen carefully.

199
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:40,166
Now, listen, catch everything that's said. Or you start tightening

200
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:44,090
up around your ears. That has nothing to do with hearing clearly.

201
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,406
Now, from the moment we were little children, when teachers in class

202
00:13:48,478 --> 00:13:52,102
screamed at us, pay attention. We go tight in various

203
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,606
ways. Either to see or hear

204
00:13:55,678 --> 00:13:59,670
more clearly, to concentrate or to will something which is

205
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,722
supposed to be difficult to do. And that constitutes

206
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:07,402
a habitual tension over the whole body that's there almost all the

207
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:11,610
time. And that feeling of unnecessary tension is,

208
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,130
as it were, the material sensation upon which we fasten this

209
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,310
concept of I. We hang it on to that feeling.

210
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,978
The concept is not us. The feeling of tension is

211
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:28,590
completely phony. It has nothing to do with success in seeing, hearing or acting.

212
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,220
And so we get the marriage of an illusion with a falsehood.

213
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,632
And that we call ourselves. And no wonder we feel cut

214
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:40,700
off from everything, alienated, frightened of life and death.

215
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,700
So what has to happen is we have to come back

216
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,464
to a sane view

217
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:56,310
of our own life, which is

218
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,730
the way we really are. An organism functioning in

219
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,442
terms of the whole environment, with the whole environment. Instead of

220
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:08,070
this funny little separate personality. But how are we going to do that?

221
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,474
People say you can't change human nature overnight. You're asking

222
00:15:12,522 --> 00:15:16,026
us to give up the ego. And that's the most difficult

223
00:15:16,058 --> 00:15:19,550
of all things to do. Actually, it isn't,

224
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,732
because the ego doesn't exist. But of course, if you

225
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,980
try to give up your ego with your ego. Then it will take

226
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,932
you to the end of time. Because this is the

227
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:34,360
point. You can't transform yourself.

228
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,156
You can't make yourself sane. You can't make yourself loving.

229
00:15:39,268 --> 00:15:41,560
You can't make yourself unselfish.

230
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,360
And yet it's absolutely necessary that we be that way.

231
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,290
It's absolutely necessary.

232
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,534
If we are going to hand over the direction

233
00:15:55,582 --> 00:15:59,050
of nature to nature, which is what it comes to.

234
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:03,070
It's absolutely necessary that we let go

235
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,210
of ourselves. And it can't be done.

236
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,158
Not by anything that we call doing it. Acting,

237
00:16:10,254 --> 00:16:13,416
willing, or even just accepting things. You can't

238
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:17,144
do it. Why? Because you don't

239
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:20,808
really exist as that kind of a separate ego or personality.

240
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:23,980
It's just an idea based on a phony feeling.

241
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,180
So when it comes down to it,

242
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,380
it's shocking news for us,

243
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,940
for the human race, for our pride.

244
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,470
You're only making a mess by trying to put things straight.

245
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,110
You're trying to straighten out a wiggly world. And no wonder you're in trouble.

246
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,402
So you can't do anything, so you can't transform

247
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:55,870
yourself. And what can you do?

248
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,282
What happens then? If you actually realize you've come to a dead end and

249
00:17:01,306 --> 00:17:04,230
the human race has come to a dead end, in my opinion,

250
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,280
what then? Commit suicide?

251
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,220
Or is there something else? What happens

252
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,080
when you just wait? There's nothing you can do.

253
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:22,348
You watch and

254
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:26,240
all you see is what goes on that is happening of itself.

255
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,160
You are breathing, the wind is blowing,

256
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,712
the trees are waving, your blood is circulating,

257
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:37,900
your nerves are tingling. It's all going on with itself.

258
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,900
But you know that's you, that's the real you,

259
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,580
the you that goes on of itself.

260
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,220
It's not the symbol,

261
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,530
it's not the person, it's you

262
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,050
that's happening. As when you breathe. Yes, you can get

263
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,602
the feeling that I am breathing by shoving your breath. But your

264
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:07,298
breath goes on day in and day out without

265
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:10,386
you doing anything about it or even thinking of it. The same way your brain

266
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:14,242
is functioning without your forcing it. So when

267
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:18,146
you come to a dead end, and we are individually and socially

268
00:18:18,258 --> 00:18:20,430
now at a dead end,

269
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,790
this is the moment of which it is said man's extremity is God's opportunity

270
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,546
because we have to stop. And when we stop,

271
00:18:32,618 --> 00:18:36,546
we find a world that is happening rather than being

272
00:18:36,618 --> 00:18:40,310
done, being shoved. And that happening,

273
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,754
as distinct from doing, is our fundamental self.

274
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:47,990
And our fundamental self is not something just inside the skin.

275
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,610
It's everything around us with which we

276
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,630
connect. When you look out of your eyes

277
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,670
at nature happening out there, you're looking at you.

278
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,110
I'm not going to say what we should do from then on,

279
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,082
but simply that before we think of

280
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:16,590
doing anything in this critical situation,

281
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,842
we realize the completely illusory nature of the

282
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:26,010
beings that we think we are and

283
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,418
get back again to the beings that we really

284
00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:33,550
are, which includes

285
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,290
all this outside

286
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,270
world no longer left outside.

287
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,830
So long as you are trying to make progress, you will go up.

288
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,550
But up always implies down.

289
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,932
So while you are trying to get better and better and better, that means that

290
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:12,640
when you get to the best, you can only go on to the worst.

291
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,160
And so you go round and round and round, ever chasing the illusion

292
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,620
that there is something outside yourself, outside your

293
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,200
here and now, be attained, that will make things better.

294
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,442
And the thing is to recover from that illusion. So a Buddha

295
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:35,190
means somebody who has woken up and discovered

296
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,982
that running around this thing may be fun and

297
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:41,590
it may be good to run around, but if you think you're going to get

298
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,062
something out of it, you're under A move because you're forever the

299
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:48,090
donkey with a carrot suspended on his own ho.

300
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,870
Now then, it goes on to say that there's only one place, one point

301
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:56,610
in this wheel from which you can become a Buddha, and that's here.

302
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,792
The devas are too happy to become Buddhas or

303
00:21:01,816 --> 00:21:05,840
to worry about becoming a Buddha. The Narakas are too miserable,

304
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,632
the Asuras are too angry, the animals are too dumb, and the

305
00:21:09,656 --> 00:21:12,928
pretties too frustrated. Only in the middle position,

306
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:16,784
the position of man, which is, you could say, the equal position,

307
00:21:16,952 --> 00:21:20,512
the position of sufficient equanimity to begin

308
00:21:20,576 --> 00:21:23,840
to think about getting off this rat race,

309
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,650
is only from there, you see, can you become a Buddha.

310
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,790
So the position of a Buddha may be represented either as not

311
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,582
on the wheel at all or is right in the middle of makes no

312
00:21:35,606 --> 00:21:39,134
difference. And so he

313
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:42,446
is just as, in a way, the axle point, the still point of the turning

314
00:21:42,478 --> 00:21:45,490
world, as to use T.S. eliot's phrase,

315
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,807
is the unmoved center, the unmoved mover,

316
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:53,572
supreme mobile, the axle tree of the world, Also the

317
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:56,516
navel. That's why yogis are said to contemplate their navel.

318
00:21:56,628 --> 00:22:00,308
Navel isn't on their tummy. It's this place, the navel

319
00:22:00,324 --> 00:22:04,388
of the world. So that's the scheme

320
00:22:04,564 --> 00:22:08,276
of cosmology, of ancient Indian

321
00:22:08,348 --> 00:22:11,320
cosmology, in which Buddhism arises.

322
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,532
So you see, therefore, a Buddha is one

323
00:22:15,676 --> 00:22:21,320
who awakens from

324
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,240
the illusion of samsara,

325
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,880
that is, from the thought

326
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,400
that there is something to get out of life,

327
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,278
that tomorrow will bring it to you, that in the course

328
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:44,370
of time it will be all right.

329
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:50,502
Therefore, one is set, pursuing time as if

330
00:22:50,526 --> 00:22:54,130
you were trying to quench your thirst by drinking salt water.

331
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,770
Now, I can exemplify this a little more strongly

332
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:04,566
by relating Buddhism to the social

333
00:23:04,638 --> 00:23:06,250
system in which it arose.

334
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:15,280
A Buddhist monk

335
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,600
is sometimes called a shramana,

336
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,960
S R a M a N, a shramana.

337
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,520
This is closely allied to the word shaman.

338
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,574
And a shaman is the holy

339
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:41,062
man in a culture that

340
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:45,130
is still hunting. It isn't settled, it isn't agrarian.

341
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,702
There is a very strong and important difference between a shaman and a

342
00:23:51,726 --> 00:23:55,290
priest. A priest

343
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,130
receives his ordination from his superiors.

344
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,040
He receives something from a tradition which is handed down.

345
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,532
A shaman doesn't. He receives

346
00:24:09,596 --> 00:24:13,600
his enlightenment by going off into the forest by himself,

347
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,320
to be completely alone.

348
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,680
A shaman is a man, in other words, who has undergone solitariness.

349
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:29,270
He's gone away into the forest to find out who

350
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,470
he really is, because it's very difficult to

351
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,038
find that out while you're with other people. The reason

352
00:24:36,094 --> 00:24:39,650
is that other people are busy all the time telling you who you are

353
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:44,342
in many, many ways. By the laws they impose on you,

354
00:24:44,446 --> 00:24:47,010
by the behavior ruts they set on you,

355
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,822
by the things they tell you, by the fact that they always call you by

356
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:53,934
your name, and by the fact that when you live among people, you have to

357
00:24:53,942 --> 00:24:55,810
be in a state of ceaseless chatter.

358
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,934
But if you want to find out who you are before your father

359
00:25:01,982 --> 00:25:05,502
and mother conceived you, who you really

360
00:25:05,606 --> 00:25:09,570
are, you almost have to go off by yourself,

361
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,606
go into the forest and stop talking, even stop thinking

362
00:25:14,718 --> 00:25:18,620
words. I be absolutely alone.

363
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,340
Listen for the great silences.

364
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,968
And then if you're lucky, you recover from the illusion

365
00:25:27,144 --> 00:25:30,180
that you're just little me with so and so.

366
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,320
And you attain the state of nirvana, which means

367
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,740
the blown out state,

368
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,832
the relieved state, the sigh of relief. Nirvana may

369
00:25:43,856 --> 00:25:47,020
be translated into English as whew.

370
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,568
I've at last discovered that I don't have

371
00:25:52,624 --> 00:25:56,088
to survive. I can

372
00:25:56,144 --> 00:25:58,660
survive, of course, but I don't really have to.

373
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,048
Because you discover, you see, that what you

374
00:26:05,104 --> 00:26:08,060
really are doesn't have to survive.

375
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,906
Because it's what there is, the real

376
00:26:11,978 --> 00:26:15,390
you, is it?

377
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:19,026
Or that tat tvam asi,

378
00:26:19,138 --> 00:26:22,030
that art thou, as the Hindus say.

379
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,250
So then, in the

380
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,786
normal life of India, which is not

381
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:34,390
a hunting culture but a settled culture,

382
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,944
there are priests, but there is something beyond

383
00:26:39,992 --> 00:26:43,752
the priest. That is to say, when a

384
00:26:43,776 --> 00:26:47,864
man or woman has fulfilled

385
00:26:47,912 --> 00:26:50,460
his or her life in the world of society,

386
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,528
it's the normal thing to do for a person

387
00:26:55,584 --> 00:27:00,370
to quit their status in society and

388
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,190
become what's called a forest dweller.

389
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:07,510
That is almost, you see, to go back to the hunting culture,

390
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,138
they divide people into two classes. Grihasta, which means

391
00:27:13,194 --> 00:27:17,270
householder, and vanaprastha, which means forest dweller.

392
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:21,730
And the older people all hand over their

393
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,470
occupations and positions to their children

394
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:29,944
and into the stage of vanaprasta, or become

395
00:27:30,032 --> 00:27:33,900
a shramana and go outside the stockade.

396
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,344
I'm speaking metaphorically. They sometimes do, actually, they sometimes

397
00:27:38,392 --> 00:27:41,980
don't, and become a nobody.

398
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,744
They give up their name, that is to say, the label

399
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:50,500
which designates who they are in terms of caste or class.

400
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,300
They become unclassified people.

401
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,940
That's why, strictly speaking, you see, Hinduism and Buddhism are not religions.

402
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,700
You can classify the religions. You can say, what's your denomination?

403
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,576
Baptist, Methodist, Catholic,

404
00:28:07,768 --> 00:28:11,432
Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Quaker, etc. Etc. Etc.

405
00:28:11,496 --> 00:28:16,060
You see? But strictly speaking, a vanaprasta,

406
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,928
a shramana, has no label. He is an

407
00:28:19,984 --> 00:28:21,580
unlabeled bottle.

408
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:28,970
So in

409
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:33,486
the Time when the Buddha lived, about 600

410
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:34,290
BC,

411
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,454
the Hindu system had become

412
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:45,570
somewhat decadent.

413
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,792
It isn't altogether clear what had happened,

414
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:52,052
but it is certain that it did seem in some way to be in need

415
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:53,080
of reform.

416
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,684
And so there were many reasons

417
00:28:59,732 --> 00:29:03,760
for this. And the Buddha, as a young man,

418
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,516
being basically troubled by the great problems that we're

419
00:29:08,548 --> 00:29:12,200
all troubled with, the problem of suffering

420
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,160
and the problem of what all this universe is about,

421
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,944
he endeavored to follow the methods

422
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:24,360
that were then being used by people who were shramanas

423
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,820
or vanaprastas, forest dwellers.

424
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,672
And at that time, it's very apparent that the main method that

425
00:29:31,696 --> 00:29:34,940
these people were using was an ascetic discipline,

426
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,464
starvation, very arduous

427
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:43,266
meditation practices, probably self

428
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:45,710
flagellation and things of that kind.

429
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,790
And it said that for seven years he practiced these austerities,

430
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,698
but he found out that they didn't lead

431
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:59,362
to liberation. And all the people who were practicing them knew they

432
00:29:59,386 --> 00:30:02,850
didn't either. But they felt that that was only because they weren't doing it

433
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:03,710
hard enough.

434
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,920
And so he propounded instead the middle way,

435
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:17,600
the way that led to liberation

436
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,388
from the rat race that I've drawn here, neither through

437
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:24,924
austerities nor through pleasure

438
00:30:24,972 --> 00:30:28,236
seeking. See, these are the two ways, the two paths.

439
00:30:28,268 --> 00:30:32,172
The people who say the

440
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:35,170
whole point of life is to enjoy it, to get the most out of it,

441
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,722
you see, the other people who tried that and then they found it was

442
00:30:38,746 --> 00:30:42,210
sour grapes or something, you know, or they burned their fingers in the pursuit of

443
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:46,082
pleasure. The girl that was so beautiful eventually fell apart or just turned into a

444
00:30:46,106 --> 00:30:48,882
shrew and whatever it was.

445
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:52,610
And so they said, instead, let us

446
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,626
torment ourselves. A lot of people enjoy

447
00:30:56,658 --> 00:31:00,052
this or get something special out of it. I was in Mexico the

448
00:31:00,076 --> 00:31:04,120
summer, and what I went there for was to study Mexican Catholicism,

449
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,400
where they make a great cult of suffering.

450
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,292
And I was very puzzled about this and wanted to understand.

451
00:31:12,476 --> 00:31:16,324
And everywhere, you know, they have these ghastly tormented

452
00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:19,956
Christs all drooling with blood, hanging on crosses

453
00:31:19,988 --> 00:31:23,540
in very contorted positions. And I realized

454
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,038
there are certain people who, who find that the

455
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:30,730
sitting on the tip of a spike is the realest place in the world.

456
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,510
Because when you're on the tip of a spike, you know, you're there.

457
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:38,094
There's no doubt about it. And also, you know,

458
00:31:38,262 --> 00:31:41,370
that you're expiating for everything this

459
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,930
somehow by sitting on this, on the spike,

460
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,530
you are paying for your guilt.

461
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,130
And so long as you hurt, you're all right.

462
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,780
See? So these shamanas were doing

463
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,200
something of the same kind.

464
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,244
And The Buddha became enlightened, became a Buddha.

465
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:06,892
He woke up at the moment when he gave up

466
00:32:06,996 --> 00:32:10,540
that kind of quest. The moment he gave up, as we

467
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,600
should say, trying to take the kingdom of heaven by storm.

468
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,160
Now what does this mean?

469
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,280
It means that in

470
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,220
his time,

471
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,700
the way of liberation had become competitive,

472
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,780
which meant it was on the wrong track.

473
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,804
There are a lot of people who we call it the holier than thou

474
00:32:49,852 --> 00:32:53,484
attitude. But we find it today with some objectionable

475
00:32:53,532 --> 00:32:57,120
Westerners who go over to Japan to study Zen Buddhism

476
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,520
and then come home and brag about the great disciplines they've undergone

477
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,820
and say, I sat with my legs crossed in one position for

478
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:10,588
10 hours as distinct from somebody else who only sat for 5 and

479
00:33:10,644 --> 00:33:14,362
always has a tendency, you know, to have a marathon and be in a competition

480
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:17,590
with others or with oneself about these things.

481
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,110
But the moment you do that, you're back on the wheel.

482
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:26,426
The best thing you can get by asceticism is to get up to the Deva

483
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:29,350
world. You can't get anywhere else by it.

484
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,830
You may get down to the Naraka world by asceticism too.

485
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:38,270
Read the story Thais by Anatole France.

486
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:43,236
So he found, you see, that the. The real

487
00:33:43,308 --> 00:33:46,640
path, the Middle way.

488
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,852
The meaning of the Middle Way is that it's the

489
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:52,520
path that can't be followed.

490
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,800
Because to get you onto the middle way,

491
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,772
I have to get into a dialogue with you, you see, and you say to

492
00:34:02,796 --> 00:34:06,228
me, because after all, it's always the student that raises the problem,

493
00:34:06,284 --> 00:34:09,482
not the teacher. You say, well, now, what's the

494
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:12,922
right thing to do? I say back to you,

495
00:34:13,106 --> 00:34:15,430
why are you looking for the right thing to do?

496
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:21,270
And then you have to consider your situation where you are.

497
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,402
You say, well, I'm looking for the right thing

498
00:34:25,426 --> 00:34:29,162
to do because I feel that I'm in the wrong situation. I don't have

499
00:34:29,186 --> 00:34:32,954
peace of mind. Why do

500
00:34:32,962 --> 00:34:36,412
you want peace of mind? Because my

501
00:34:36,436 --> 00:34:40,000
mind is disturbed. Then in other words,

502
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,788
you as a disturbed mind, are trying to find peace of mind.

503
00:34:43,844 --> 00:34:47,720
Your quest for peace of mind is the same thing as having a disturbed mind.

504
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,360
Now, if you don't have a disturbed mind, you won't ask peace of mind?

505
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,556
Well, how can I quiet my mind? Why are you asking to quiet your mind?

506
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:59,720
Because it's disturbed. You see where you are?

507
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,132
So in this way, by this dialogue, the. The guru,

508
00:35:04,196 --> 00:35:06,680
the teacher, brings a person back to center.

509
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,892
So then this is the point. All Buddhist teaching is

510
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:19,844
a dialogue, really and truly. The man

511
00:35:19,932 --> 00:35:24,020
who goes out and leaves society

512
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,750
and becomes in monk is

513
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:32,374
a little bit Too much Buddhism

514
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,494
involves this act as a preliminary

515
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:39,510
gesture. But what it

516
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:43,142
comes to in the end is the position of

517
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:47,654
what's called a bodhisattva. A bodhisattva

518
00:35:47,702 --> 00:35:51,472
means somebody who went out of society or

519
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:55,184
we should say, gave up the world in some way, took on the

520
00:35:55,272 --> 00:35:57,860
the robe, took on the discipline.

521
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,448
He found what he was looking for, but his

522
00:36:02,504 --> 00:36:06,784
finding it was absolutely simultaneous with his coming

523
00:36:06,872 --> 00:36:08,180
back into society.

524
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,504
It is called a bodhisattva, as distinct

525
00:36:15,552 --> 00:36:18,766
from a Pratyaka Buddha, which means a private

526
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:22,410
Buddha, one who goes out and doesn't come back.

527
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:27,250
And the Bodhisattva is considered as having a superior attainment,

528
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,730
superior insight.

529
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:38,222
So the important thing to remember then is Buddhism is a

530
00:36:38,246 --> 00:36:42,650
dialogue and

531
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,872
its teaching is a method and not a

532
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:50,584
doctrine. Now, the teaching of Buddhism

533
00:36:50,632 --> 00:36:54,460
is summed up in what are called the four Noble Truths.

534
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,056
The truth of suffering, the truth about the origin

535
00:37:02,088 --> 00:37:05,500
of suffering, the truth about the ceasing of suffering,

536
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,140
and the truth about the way to the ceasing of suffering.

537
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,638
Dukha d u h k h

538
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:18,854
a is the Sanskrit word we translate

539
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:19,610
suffering,

540
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,390
discord, frustration, something like

541
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:27,650
that. That's always the problem, you see.

542
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,846
And this because of suffering is the reason why human

543
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:34,950
beings seek out teachers and

544
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:39,030
saviors. I hurt

545
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:43,922
and I don't want to hurt. So that's the

546
00:37:44,026 --> 00:37:47,110
universal problem, see that everybody brings.

547
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:52,930
So then the teacher replies to this problem by

548
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:53,550
saying,

549
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,110
you suffer because you crave things.

550
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,148
Trishna T r I s

551
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:10,040
h n a from which we get our word. First,

552
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,220
Trishna, craving or desire is

553
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,560
the cause of suffering. That's the second truth.

554
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,620
Now the Buddhist analyzes this. That's the

555
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,970
world is dukkha because full

556
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:32,390
of frustration. And it's also characterized by impermanence

557
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:38,386
and by non

558
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,590
entity ness.

559
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:45,590
That means that no thing exists independently.

560
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:50,114
Everything is a thing only in relation to everything else.

561
00:38:50,242 --> 00:38:54,252
Therefore there are no separate things, no real selves

562
00:38:54,396 --> 00:38:56,880
or souls or egos.

563
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,860
And trying to cling to the world which

564
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,524
is necessarily changing, trying to have a separate

565
00:39:06,572 --> 00:39:09,996
self and to protect it, all these things are

566
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:13,840
trishna, they are the cause of dukkha.

567
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,988
So the teachers having said this,

568
00:39:19,044 --> 00:39:22,450
then the student comes back and says, well,

569
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:26,866
how do I get rid of Krishna if

570
00:39:26,938 --> 00:39:31,010
Krishna desire is the cause of suffering, couldn't I

571
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,910
get rid of desire so as not to suffer?

572
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,910
And the teacher says, well, you try.

573
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:42,482
And this then is the first part of the discipline. To try not

574
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:46,190
to desire, to calm your mind,

575
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:50,298
to practice centering, to practice getting

576
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:54,010
rid of all what they call klesha K L

577
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:57,674
E S A disturbing thoughts,

578
00:39:57,802 --> 00:40:00,270
distractions, evil passions,

579
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,842
immoderate appetites and come to upeksha or

580
00:40:06,866 --> 00:40:08,390
equanimity of mind.

581
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:14,222
And so the student practices that, that and

582
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:17,790
this is a very difficult and arduous discipline. And all the time

583
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,974
he sees the teacher watching him with a slightly sour expression on

584
00:40:20,982 --> 00:40:24,526
his face and he knows, of course, or thinks

585
00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:28,222
he knows that the teacher is fully aware

586
00:40:28,286 --> 00:40:31,806
of his inmost thoughts. Because you know, it's the Indian

587
00:40:31,878 --> 00:40:35,310
way. They go to meeting with the teacher and the teacher sits under

588
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,662
a tree and smokes a cigarette or a pipe or something and

589
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,806
all the students sit around cross legged and they, they meditate.

590
00:40:42,998 --> 00:40:46,390
Sometimes the teacher meditates and they can see him

591
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,702
occasionally looking at them like this and

592
00:40:49,726 --> 00:40:54,166
they think, oh, teacher knows what I'm thinking because

593
00:40:54,238 --> 00:40:58,730
he has the power of infinite vision, you see, and all seeingness.

594
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,174
And this bugs them completely because you see,

595
00:41:03,262 --> 00:41:06,232
you remember how it was in school when you were trying to do something,

596
00:41:06,326 --> 00:41:09,828
the teacher walked around and looked over your shoulder. It puts

597
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:13,396
you off completely. And so the Hindu

598
00:41:13,428 --> 00:41:17,040
teacher or the Buddhist teacher deliberately puts his students off

599
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,920
and finally he raises in their minds an insoluble problem

600
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,500
that if you are trying to stop desire so that you will not

601
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,600
suffer, aren't you still desiring to stop desire?

602
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,862
Or the students may very well find that out for themselves and

603
00:41:36,886 --> 00:41:39,902
they say to the teacher, but how are we to stop desire when we are

604
00:41:39,926 --> 00:41:41,570
desiring to stop desire?

605
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:48,654
So then the teacher can engage them in an extremely marvelous

606
00:41:48,702 --> 00:41:49,410
trap,

607
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:56,782
which is to say he

608
00:41:56,806 --> 00:42:00,132
can, he can play it in a number of different directions. One direction is

609
00:42:00,156 --> 00:42:04,040
to say, well, don't try to stop all desire,

610
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,800
but try to stop as much desire as you can stop.

611
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,548
You see where this is going to go? Then they're

612
00:42:18,564 --> 00:42:19,680
going to say, well,

613
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,290
I'm a little excessive about the desiring to stop desire.

614
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:31,930
Well, if you're naturally excessive about it, he says,

615
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:36,222
try to be as slightly excessive as you

616
00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:38,170
can see.

617
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:42,446
Now do you see what's meeting here? If you follow

618
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:46,222
that course, you are

619
00:42:46,246 --> 00:42:50,142
being brought to center in

620
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,410
the same way as I demonstrated before.

621
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,168
You're being brought to yourself to accept yourself

622
00:42:57,264 --> 00:43:00,180
as you are here and now totally.

623
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,752
But you can't do that directly because if

624
00:43:04,776 --> 00:43:08,080
you try to accept yourself, you will always find

625
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,984
that in yourself there is a spirit of the non acceptance

626
00:43:12,032 --> 00:43:15,340
of things and you have to accept that.

627
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:22,122
So the teacher would say don't try to accept yourself

628
00:43:22,186 --> 00:43:25,322
more than you can accept yourself. Accept yourself as much

629
00:43:25,346 --> 00:43:29,370
as you can accept yourself because then

630
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:32,870
you see, you are also accepting the part of you that doesn't accept.

631
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:39,430
Or he may try on another tack. He may say,

632
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:45,438
all right, now, if you've seen that it's that

633
00:43:45,494 --> 00:43:49,278
desiring not to desire is simply another

634
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:50,690
form of desire,

635
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:55,742
you, you're trying, for example, to get rid of your

636
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:59,182
sensuous appetites. You are

637
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:03,726
going to give up booze and women and foie

638
00:44:03,758 --> 00:44:05,450
gras or whatever it may be.

639
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,328
You then think, well, now, yes, this I must

640
00:44:16,384 --> 00:44:16,980
do.

641
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:29,688
And eventually you find that

642
00:44:29,744 --> 00:44:33,900
you are becoming proud

643
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:39,750
of your success in mastering your appetites,

644
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:44,110
and you're beginning to depend on that.

645
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:50,562
So the teacher says, do you see? You're in the same trap as you

646
00:44:50,586 --> 00:44:54,034
always were. Formerly you sought

647
00:44:54,082 --> 00:44:57,490
spiritual security in booze and women and

648
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:00,630
so on. Now you're seeking it in holiness.

649
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:06,146
Formerly you bound yourself with chains of iron. Now you're bound

650
00:45:06,178 --> 00:45:10,114
with chains of gold. Formerly you boasted to all the boys how

651
00:45:10,122 --> 00:45:13,522
many sins you committed. Now you're boasting before the Lord of

652
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:16,390
how many virtues you have. Same trap.

653
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:22,498
Why do you do it? So the

654
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:28,028
student eventually finds there's no way at all to

655
00:45:28,084 --> 00:45:29,360
not desire.

656
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,040
Even desiring not to desire is desiring.

657
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:39,532
Even trying to accept oneself is a way

658
00:45:39,556 --> 00:45:42,716
of trying to escape from oneself. Because one hopes,

659
00:45:42,748 --> 00:45:45,980
psychotherapeutically, that by accepting yourself you

660
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,160
will get rid of your nasty symptoms.

661
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,876
So you're not accepting them. You're not accepting them by the gimmick,

662
00:45:52,988 --> 00:45:55,320
by the pretense of trying to accept them.

663
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,320
So this is the way.

664
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:40,690
Well, now really, when we go back then to falling in love

665
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:53,950
and say it's crazy falling,

666
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:59,190
you see, we don't say rising into love.

667
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:05,030
There is in it the idea of the fall.

668
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:10,346
And it is goes back, as a matter of fact, to extremely

669
00:47:10,378 --> 00:47:14,602
fundamental, fundamental things, that there

670
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:18,762
is always a curious tie

671
00:47:18,826 --> 00:47:24,202
at some point between the fall and

672
00:47:24,226 --> 00:47:28,074
the creation. Taking this ghastly

673
00:47:28,122 --> 00:47:31,962
risk is the

674
00:47:32,066 --> 00:47:34,230
condition of there being life,

675
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,452
you see, for all the life is

676
00:47:40,556 --> 00:47:43,240
an act of faith and an act of gamble.

677
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,470
The moment you take a step,

678
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:24,962
you do so on an act of faith, because you don't really know that the

679
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:26,790
floor is not going to give under your feet.

680
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,280
The moment you take a journey, what an act of faith.

681
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:41,244
The moment you enter into any kind of human undertaking

682
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:44,188
in relationship, what an act of faith, see,

683
00:48:44,244 --> 00:48:48,060
you've given yourself up, but this

684
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,252
is the most powerful thing that could be done.

685
00:48:50,356 --> 00:48:53,736
Surrender, see? And love is an act of surrender

686
00:48:53,868 --> 00:48:55,260
to another person.

687
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,980
Total abandonment.

688
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,860
I give myself,

689
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,310
take you wear anything you like.

690
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:30,570
So that's quite Mad.

691
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:33,030
Because you see, it's letting things get out of control.

692
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:35,990
All sensible people keep things in control.

693
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,190
Watch it, watch it. Watch it.

694
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:44,830
Security, Vigilance.

695
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:49,588
Watch it. Police. Watch it. Gods, watch it.

696
00:49:49,644 --> 00:49:50,960
There's better. Watch the car.

697
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:14,926
So actually, therefore,

698
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:18,770
the, the, the course of wisdom, what is really sensible

699
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:22,862
is to let go, is to commit oneself to give oneself up.

700
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:26,702
And that's quite mad. So we come to the strange conclusion that

701
00:50:26,726 --> 00:50:27,694
in madness lies.

702
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,280
Look, will you be absolutely genuine with me?

703
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:39,052
No deception please. I want you to

704
00:51:39,076 --> 00:51:42,476
do something that expresses you without the slightest

705
00:51:42,508 --> 00:51:43,360
deception.

706
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:49,836
No more role acting, no more playing

707
00:51:49,908 --> 00:51:54,652
games with me. I want to see you now.

708
00:51:54,676 --> 00:51:58,156
Imagine, could you really

709
00:51:58,228 --> 00:52:00,400
be that honest with somebody else?

710
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,660
Especially a spiritual teacher. And you

711
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,628
know, he looks right through you. He sees all

712
00:52:09,684 --> 00:52:14,280
your secret thoughts. And he knows the very second

713
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,880
when you've been a little bit phony.

714
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:22,090
And that bugs you. In other words,

715
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:25,770
when you're challenged to be perfectly genuine.

716
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:29,622
It's like saying to a child, now darling, come out here

717
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,930
and play and don't be self conscious.

718
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:37,734
Or it's like I would say to you, now look, if you come here tonight

719
00:52:37,782 --> 00:52:40,810
at exactly midnight and put your hands on this stage,

720
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:45,158
you can wish and have granted any wish you want in provided

721
00:52:45,254 --> 00:52:47,130
you don't think of a green elephant.

722
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:55,062
And so everybody will come, they'll put their hands here and they will

723
00:52:55,086 --> 00:52:57,610
be very careful not to think about a green elephant.

724
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:06,438
Well, now do you see the point that

725
00:53:06,494 --> 00:53:09,928
everybody, if we transfer this to the dimension of,

726
00:53:09,974 --> 00:53:13,700
of spirituality where the highest ideal is

727
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,120
to be unselfish,

728
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,080
to let go of oneself.

729
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:26,180
When you are trying to be unselfish,

730
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,160
you're doing it for a selfish reason.

731
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:34,932
You can't be unselfish by a decision of the

732
00:53:34,956 --> 00:53:38,824
will anymore. Then you can decide not to think of a green

733
00:53:38,872 --> 00:53:42,664
elephant. There is a story about

734
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:45,928
Confucius who one day met Lao

735
00:53:45,944 --> 00:53:49,260
Tzu, who was a great Chinese philosopher.

736
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,580
And Lao Tzu said, sir, what is your system?

737
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,952
And Confucius said, it is charity and love

738
00:53:56,976 --> 00:54:00,180
of one's neighbor and elimination of self interest.

739
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:05,030
Lao Tzu said, stuff and nonsense.

740
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:10,722
Your elimination of self is

741
00:54:10,746 --> 00:54:13,030
a positive manifestation of self.

742
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:17,970
Look at the universe. The stars keep their

743
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:21,842
order. The trees and plants

744
00:54:21,906 --> 00:54:25,270
grow upwards without exception. The waters flow

745
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:30,140
the like. This all your nonsense about

746
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:33,772
elimination of self is like beating a drum in search of a

747
00:54:33,796 --> 00:54:38,040
fugitive. So in this way

748
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:44,332
these are all examples of the thing that trickery the

749
00:54:44,356 --> 00:54:47,880
master is playing on you.

750
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:52,758
You came to him with the idea in your mind that

751
00:54:52,814 --> 00:54:55,930
you are a separate, independent,

752
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:59,782
isolated individual. And what he is Simply saying to

753
00:54:59,806 --> 00:55:02,650
you is, show me this individual.

754
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:07,410
So after a while you see what happens is this.

755
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:12,582
When the student finds that there is absolutely

756
00:55:12,646 --> 00:55:16,310
no way of being his

757
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:17,290
true self,

758
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,420
not only is there no way of doing it,

759
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,220
there is also no way of doing it. By not doing it,

760
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,328
you can't do it by doing something. You can't do it by not doing

761
00:55:37,384 --> 00:55:40,464
something. So in this way,

762
00:55:40,632 --> 00:55:45,046
what is called the Zen problem or koan is

763
00:55:45,198 --> 00:55:48,774
likened to a person who swallowed a

764
00:55:48,782 --> 00:55:52,742
ball of red hot iron. He can't

765
00:55:52,806 --> 00:55:55,090
gulp it down and he can't spit it out.

766
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:59,210
Or it's like a mosquito biting an iron bull.

767
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,050
It's the nature of a mosquito to bite,

768
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:06,570
and it's the nature of an iron bull to be unbitable,

769
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:11,370
and both go on doing their thing. That is their nature.

770
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:13,810
And so nothing can happen.

771
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:17,730
Absolutely, you're up against it.

772
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:21,810
Absolutely no answer to this problem.

773
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:27,010
No way out. Now, what does that mean?

774
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:34,262
If I can't do the right thing by doing,

775
00:56:34,366 --> 00:56:37,862
and if I can't do the right thing by not doing, what does it mean?

776
00:56:37,966 --> 00:56:39,650
It means, of course,

777
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:50,460
that I, who essayed to do all this,

778
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,720
am a hallucination.

779
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:00,284
There is no independent self to

780
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:03,980
be produced. There is no way

781
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,880
at all of showing it,

782
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,300
because it isn't there.

783
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:18,056
So you recover from the illusion. You suddenly wake

784
00:57:18,088 --> 00:57:19,060
up and think,

785
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:27,240
what a relief. And they call that satori.

786
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,460
That's awakening, the first step in awakening.

787
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:35,310
Let me try and translate this.

788
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:40,790
When this kind of experience happens, you discover

789
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:45,458
that what you are is

790
00:57:45,514 --> 00:57:49,938
no longer this sort of isolated

791
00:57:50,034 --> 00:57:53,714
center of action and experience locked up

792
00:57:53,722 --> 00:57:54,790
in your skin.

793
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,520
The teacher has asked you to produce that thing.

794
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:04,748
So in the same way, when your own inner sense of identity

795
00:58:04,844 --> 00:58:09,360
changes from being the separate individual

796
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:14,684
to being what the entire cosmos

797
00:58:14,732 --> 00:58:16,360
is doing at this place,

798
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:21,680
you become not a puppet,

799
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:28,134
but more truly and more expressively an individual

800
00:58:28,182 --> 00:58:31,414
than ever. There is a Chinese

801
00:58:31,462 --> 00:58:35,318
proverb that if the wrong man uses the right

802
00:58:35,374 --> 00:58:38,610
means, the right means work in the wrong way.

803
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:43,450
Let us assume that our technological knowledge

804
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:47,398
is the right means. What kind of people

805
00:58:47,454 --> 00:58:51,710
are going to use this knowledge? Are they going to be people who hate nature

806
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:54,470
and feel alienated from it,

807
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:02,010
or people who love the physical world and

808
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:05,642
feel that the physical world is their own personal

809
00:59:05,746 --> 00:59:06,390
body?

810
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:16,260
But you see this whole attitude of using technology as

811
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:24,468
a method of fighting the world will

812
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:27,280
succeed only in destroying the world.
