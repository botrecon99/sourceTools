1
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,008
That what I want, basically what I really want is what you

2
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:31,634
want and I don't know what you want surprise

3
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:32,270
me.

4
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,390
But that's my, that's the kinship between I and thou.

5
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,138
So when I ask, I go right down to the question,

6
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:51,790
should we start it with what do I want?

7
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,170
The answer is I don't know.

8
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,570
When Bodhidharma was asked who are you? Which is another form of the same question,

9
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,810
he said, I don't know. Planting flowers to which the butterflies come,

10
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,530
Bodhidharma says, I know not,

11
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,490
I don't know what happened.

12
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,952
When you really don't know, you see, there's a.

13
00:01:25,976 --> 00:01:29,472
There's a beginning stage of not knowing and there's an ending stage of not knowing.

14
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:32,160
In the beginning stage you don't know what you want because you haven't thought about

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,340
it or you've only thought superficially.

16
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,944
Then when you, somebody forces you to think about it and go through and say,

17
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,360
yeah, I think I'd like this, I think I like that, I think I'd like

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,122
the other as the middle stage. Then you get beyond that,

19
00:01:45,226 --> 00:01:48,910
say, is that what I really want? In the end you say,

20
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,250
no, I don't think that's it. I might

21
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,482
be satisfied with it for a while and I wouldn't turn my nose up at

22
00:01:56,506 --> 00:01:59,970
it, but it's not really what I want. Why don't you really know what you

23
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,590
want?

24
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,794
Two reasons that you don't really know what you want.

25
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,150
Number one, you have it.

26
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,910
Number two,

27
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,910
you don't know yourself because you never can.

28
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,190
The Godhead is never an object of its own knowledge.

29
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,346
Just as a knife doesn't cut itself, fire doesn't burn itself,

30
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:36,276
light doesn't illumine itself. It's always

31
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:39,840
an endless mystery to itself. I don't know.

32
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,468
And this I don't know uttered in the infinite

33
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:46,680
interior of the spirit,

34
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,180
this I don't know is

35
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,000
the same thing as I love.

36
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,900
I let go. I don't try to force or control.

37
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,620
It's the same thing as humility.

38
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,700
And so the Upanishads say,

39
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,460
if you think that you understand Brahman,

40
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,256
you do not understand and you have yet

41
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,642
to be instructed. Further, if you know that

42
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,550
you do not understand, then you truly understand.

43
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,090
For the Brahman is unknown to those

44
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,790
who know it and known to those who know it not.

45
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,750
And the principle is that

46
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,710
anytime you, as it were,

47
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,836
voluntarily let up control, in other words,

48
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:55,212
cease to cling to yourself, you have an

49
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:59,228
access of power because

50
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:02,480
you're wasting energy all the time in self defense,

51
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,628
trying to manage things, trying to force things to conform to your will.

52
00:04:07,684 --> 00:04:11,080
The moment you stop doing that, that wasted energy is available.

53
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,100
Therefore you are in that sense having that energy available.

54
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,960
You are one with the divine principle. You have the energy.

55
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,480
When you're trying, however, to act as if you were God,

56
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,772
that is to say, you don't trust anybody and you're the dictator and you have

57
00:04:27,796 --> 00:04:31,452
to keep everybody in line, you lose the divine energy because what

58
00:04:31,476 --> 00:04:33,440
you're doing is simply defending yourself.

59
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,760
So then the principle is the more you give it away,

60
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,452
the more it comes back. Now you say, I don't have the courage to give

61
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:45,680
it away. I'm afraid.

62
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,830
And you can only overcome that by realizing you

63
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,370
better give it away because there's no way holding onto it.

64
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,054
The meaning of the fact, you see that everything is dissolving constantly,

65
00:05:04,102 --> 00:05:07,494
that we're all falling apart, we're all in a process of constant

66
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:11,222
death, and that the worldly hope men set their

67
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:14,422
hearts upon turns ashes, or it plots, prospers, and like snow upon the

68
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:17,958
desert's dusty face lighting a little hour or two is gone. You know, all that

69
00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:19,690
Omar Kayan jazz,

70
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,406
you know, the cloud cat towers, the gorgeous palaces, the great globe

71
00:05:26,438 --> 00:05:30,374
itself I all which it inherits shall dissolve and like this insubstantial

72
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:34,090
pageant faded, leave not a rack behind. All falling apart.

73
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,610
Everything is. That's the. The great assistance to you

74
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,310
see that. That fact that everything is in decay is your

75
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,204
helper that is allowing you

76
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:50,668
that you don't have to let go because

77
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:52,280
there's nothing to hold on to.

78
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,840
It's achieved for you, in other words, by the process of nature.

79
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,480
So once you see that you just don't have a prayer,

80
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,220
it's all washed up and that you will

81
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,120
vanish and leave not a rack behind.

82
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,130
And you really get with that.

83
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,250
Suddenly you find you have the power,

84
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,610
this enormous access of energy.

85
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,430
But it's not power that came to you because you

86
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,250
grabbed it came in entirely the opposite way.

87
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,062
And power that comes to you in that opposite way

88
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:34,342
is power with which you can

89
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:35,470
be trusted.

90
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,402
That what I want, basically what I really want is

91
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:07,362
what you want. And I don't know what you surprised

92
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,030
me,

93
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,150
but that's my. That's the kinship between I and thou.

94
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,898
So when I ask, I go right down to the question,

95
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:27,600
should we start it with what do I want?

96
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,960
The answer is, I don't know.

97
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,324
When Bodhidharma was asked, who are you? Which is another form of

98
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:39,044
the same question, he said, I don't know.

99
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:41,600
Planting flowers to which the butterflies come,

100
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:47,092
Bodhidharma says I know not I

101
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:49,908
don't know what I want. When you don't know what you want,

102
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:58,472
you've reached the state of desirelessness when

103
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:02,024
you really don't know. You see, there's a. There's a

104
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:05,192
beginning stage of not knowing and there's an ending stage of not knowing.

105
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:07,880
In the beginning stage you don't know what you want because you haven't thought about

106
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,140
it or you've only thought superficially.

107
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,696
Then when you somebody forces you to think about it and go through and say,

108
00:08:14,768 --> 00:08:17,112
yeah, I think I like this, I think I like that, I think I'd like

109
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:20,912
the other as the middle stage. Then you get beyond that,

110
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:24,700
say, is that what I really want? In the end you say,

111
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,040
no, I don't think that's it. I might

112
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,272
be satisfied with it for a while and I wouldn't turn my nose up at

113
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:35,552
it, but it's not really what I want. Why don't you really know what

114
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:36,300
you want?

115
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,752
Two reasons that you don't really know what

116
00:08:42,776 --> 00:08:45,920
you want. Number one, you have it.

117
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,600
Number two,

118
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,600
you don't know yourself because you never can.

119
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,960
The Godhead is never an object of its own knowledge.

120
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,164
Just as a knife doesn't cut itself, fire doesn't burn itself,

121
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:11,996
light doesn't illumine itself. It's always

122
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:15,640
an endless mystery to itself. I don't know.

123
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,220
And this I don't know uttered in the infinite

124
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,480
interior of the Spirit.

125
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,980
This I don't know is

126
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,880
the same thing as I love. I let go,

127
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,690
I don't try to force or control.

128
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,330
It's the same thing as humility.

129
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,490
And so the Upanishad said,

130
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,250
if you think that you understand Brahman,

131
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,046
you do not understand and you have yet

132
00:09:59,118 --> 00:10:02,422
to be instructed. Further, if you know that

133
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:05,340
you do not understand, then you truly understand.

134
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,440
For the Brahman is unknown to those who know it

135
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,580
and known to those who know it not.

136
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,460
And the principle is that

137
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,420
anytime you, as it were,

138
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,352
voluntarily let up control, in other words, cease to cling to

139
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:34,970
yourself. You have an access of power because

140
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:40,250
you're wasting energy all the time in self defense trying

141
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,962
to manage things, trying to force things to conform to your will. The moment you

142
00:10:43,986 --> 00:10:46,790
stop doing that, that wasted energy is available.

143
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,858
Therefore you are in that sense having that energy available.

144
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:55,750
You are one with the divine principle, you have the energy.

145
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,280
When you're trying, however, to act as if you were God.

146
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,524
That is to say, you don't trust anybody and you're the dictator and you have

147
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:07,028
to keep everybody in line. You lose the divine energy because

148
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,240
what you're doing is simply defending yourself.

149

So then the principle is, the more you give it away,

150
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,204
the more it comes back. Now you say, I don't have the courage to give

151
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,400
it away. I'm afraid.

152
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,562
And you can only overcome that by realizing you

153
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:34,150
better give it away because there's no way holding on to it.

154
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,786
The meaning of the fact, you see that everything is dissolving constantly.

155
00:11:39,818 --> 00:11:43,910
That we're all falling apart. We're all in a process of constant death.

156
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,948
And that the worldly hope men set their hearts apart pond turns

157
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:51,548
ashes or it prospers and likes snow upon the desert's dusty face lighting

158
00:11:51,564 --> 00:11:55,440
a little hour or two is gone. You know, all that Omar Khayyam jazz,

159
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,740
you know, the cloud cat towers, the gorgeous palaces, the great

160
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,100
globe itself I all which it inherits shall dissolve and like

161
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,428
this insubstantial pageant faded leave not a rack behind.

162
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:11,708
All falling apart. Everything is.

163
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:15,510
That's the. The great assistance to you see that

164
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,990
that fact that everything is in decay is your helper that

165
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,430
is allowing you that you don't have to let

166
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,966
go because there's nothing

167
00:12:26,998 --> 00:12:30,742
to hold on to. It's achieved

168
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:33,610
for you, in other words, by the process of nature.

169
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,902
So once you see that you just don't have a prayer and

170
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,334
it's all washed up and that you will vanish

171
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:43,850
and leave not a rack behind.

172
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,850
And you really get with that.

173
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:53,054
Suddenly you find you have the power, this enormous

174
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:57,290
access of energy. But it's not power

175
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,390
that came to you because you grabbed. It came in

176
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,102
entirely the opposite way. And power that comes to you in

177
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:09,672
that opposite way is power with

178
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:11,180
which you can be trusted.

179
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,020
Well, now,

180
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,740
the easiest way to get into the meditative state

181
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,990
is to begin by listening.

182
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:43,162
If you simply close your eyes and

183
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:47,050
allow yourself to hear all the sounds that are going

184
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,150
on around you.

185
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,930
Just listen to the general hum and

186
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,322
buzz of the world as if you were

187
00:13:57,346 --> 00:13:58,550
listening to music.

188
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,680
Don't try to identify the sounds you're hearing.

189
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,320
Don't put names on them.

190
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,108
Simply allow them to play

191
00:14:13,164 --> 00:14:19,440
with your eardrums and

192
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,532
let them go. In other words, you could

193
00:14:24,556 --> 00:14:28,202
put it. Let your ears hear whatever they want to

194
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:32,074
hear. Don't judge

195
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:35,562
the sounds. There are no, as it

196
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:39,130
were, proper sounds or improper sounds. And it doesn't matter

197
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:44,026
if somebody coughs or sneezes or drops

198
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:46,910
something. It's all just sound.

199
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,882
And if I am talking to you right now and

200
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:57,532
you're doing this, I want you to listen to

201
00:14:57,556 --> 00:15:00,480
the sound of my voice just as if it were noise.

202
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,120
Don't try to make any sense out of what I'm saying,

203
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,660
because your brain will take care of that automatically.

204
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,452
You don't have to try to understand anything, just listen to

205
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:12,240
the sound.

206
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,900
As you pursue that experiment, you will very naturally

207
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:25,478
find that you can't help naming

208
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:28,918
sounds, identifying them, that you will go on

209
00:15:28,974 --> 00:15:32,390
thinking, that is to say, talking to yourself inside your

210
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,090
head automatically.

211
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:40,038
But it's important that you don't try to repress those thoughts

212
00:15:40,214 --> 00:15:42,450
by forcing them out of your mind,

213
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,062
because that will have precisely the same effect as

214
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:51,000
if you were trying to smooth rough water with a flat iron.

215
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,960
You're just going to disturb it all the more. What you do is this.

216
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,868
As you hear sounds coming up in your head,

217
00:15:59,004 --> 00:16:02,480
thoughts, you simply listen to them

218
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,404
as part of the general noise going on, just as you

219
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:09,524
would be listening to the sound of my voice, or just as you

220
00:16:09,532 --> 00:16:13,348
would be listening to cars going by, or to birds

221
00:16:13,444 --> 00:16:17,388
chattering outside the window. So look at your

222
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:20,320
own thoughts as just noises,

223
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,100
and soon you will find that the

224
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,732
so called outside world and the so called inside

225
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:32,480
world come together. They are a happening.

226
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,244
Your thoughts are a happening, just like

227
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:40,892
the sounds going on outside. And everything is simply

228
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:44,270
a happening and all you're doing is watching it.

229
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,714
Now, in this process, another thing that is happening

230
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:55,110
that is very important is that you're breathing.

231
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,630
And as you start meditation,

232
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:06,242
you allow your breath to run just

233
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:10,476
as it wills. In other words, don't do

234
00:17:10,548 --> 00:17:14,412
at first any breathing exercise, but just

235
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:18,000
watch your breath, breathing the way it wants to breathe.

236
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,840
And notice a curious thing about this.

237
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,520
You say in the ordinary way I breathe,

238
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,818
because you feel that breathing is, is something that you are

239
00:17:35,874 --> 00:17:39,130
doing voluntarily, just in the same

240
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,750
way as you might be walking or talking.

241
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,338
But you will also notice that when you are not thinking about

242
00:17:47,394 --> 00:17:50,630
breathing, your breathing goes on just the same.

243
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,602
So the curious thing about breath is that it can be

244
00:17:56,626 --> 00:18:00,442
looked at both as a voluntary and an involuntary

245
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:03,652
action. You can feel, on the one hand I

246
00:18:03,676 --> 00:18:07,380
am doing it, and on the other hand it is happening to

247
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,740
me. And that is why breathing is

248
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,260
a most important part of meditation, because it is

249
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,360
going to show you, as you become aware of your breath,

250
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,320
that the hard and fast division that we make

251
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,484
between what we do on the one hand and what happens

252
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:30,030
to us on the other is arbitrary.

253
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,030
So that as you watch your breathing, you will become aware

254
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,506
that both the voluntary and

255
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:44,378
the involuntary aspects of your experience are

256
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:46,350
all one happening.

257
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,970
Now, that may at first seem a little scary because you

258
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,500
may think, well, am I just the puppet,

259
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,128
a happening? The mere passive witness of something that's going on

260
00:18:58,184 --> 00:19:02,080
completely beyond my control, or on the other

261
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,168
hand, am I really

262
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:08,992
doing everything that's going along? Well, if I were, I should

263
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:12,592
be God. And that would be very embarrassing because I would be

264
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:15,660
in charge of everything. That would be terribly responsible position.

265
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,900
The truth of the matter, as you will see it,

266
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,550
is that both things are true.

267
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,150
You can see it, that everything is happening to you.

268
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,314
And on the other hand, you're doing everything. For example,

269
00:19:32,442 --> 00:19:35,834
it's your eyes that are turning the sun into light.

270
00:19:36,002 --> 00:19:39,470
It's the nerve ends in your skin that are turning

271
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,270
electric vibrations in the air into heat and temperature.

272
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,692
It's your eardrums that are turning vibrations in

273
00:19:48,716 --> 00:19:52,004
the air into sound. And in that way you are creating

274
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:57,092
the world. But when

275
00:19:57,116 --> 00:20:00,580
we are not talking about it, when we are not philosophizing about

276
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,932
it, then there is just this happening,

277
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:05,600
this.

278
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,640
And we won't give it a name.

279
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,050
Now then, when you breathe for a while,

280
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,910
just letting it happen and

281
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:29,290
not forcing it in any way, you will discover a curious thing,

282
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,982
that without making any effort, you can breathe

283
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:35,490
more and more deeply.

284
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,380
In other words, supposing you simply are breathing out.

285
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,592
And breathing out is important because it's the breath of relaxation,

286
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:49,432
as when we say, and heave a

287
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,712
sigh of relief. So when you

288
00:20:52,736 --> 00:20:56,072
are breathing out, you get the

289
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:59,540
sensation that your breath is falling out,

290
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,318
dropping, dropping, dropping out, with the same

291
00:21:06,374 --> 00:21:10,158
sort of feeling you have, as if you were settling down into an

292
00:21:10,214 --> 00:21:13,518
extremely comfortable bed. And you

293
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:16,750
just get as heavy as possible and let yourself

294
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,350
go. And you let your breath go out in just that

295
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,342
way. And when it's thoroughly,

296
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:26,490
comfortably out and it feels like coming back again,

297
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,156
you don't pull it back in. You let it fall

298
00:21:30,228 --> 00:21:34,284
back in, letting your lungs expand,

299
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:38,412
expand, expand, until they feel very comfortably

300
00:21:38,476 --> 00:21:41,932
full. And you wait a moment and let it

301
00:21:41,956 --> 00:21:45,820
stay there. And then once again, you let it

302
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,340
fall out. And so in this

303
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,572
way you will discover that your breath gets quite

304
00:21:52,636 --> 00:21:56,570
naturally easier and easier and slower and

305
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,950
slower and more and more powerful.

306
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:07,178
So that with these various

307
00:22:07,354 --> 00:22:09,950
aids, listening to sound,

308
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,290
listening to your own interior feelings and thoughts,

309
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,762
just as if they were something going on, not something you are

310
00:22:18,786 --> 00:22:22,490
doing, but just happenings. And watching your breath as

311
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,610
a happening that is neither voluntary nor involuntary.

312
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,170
You are simply a aware of these basic sensations.

313
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:33,330
Then you begin to be in the state of meditation.

314
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,382
But don't hurry anything. Don't worry about the

315
00:22:38,406 --> 00:22:41,850
future. Don't worry about what progress you're making.

316
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,998
Just be entirely content to be aware

317
00:22:46,174 --> 00:22:49,822
of what is. Don't be terribly

318
00:22:49,886 --> 00:22:53,332
selective. Particular say I should think of this and not of that.

319
00:22:53,486 --> 00:22:56,220
Just watch. Whatever is happening,

320
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,940
the Earth is not a big rock

321
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,816
infested with living organisms,

322
00:28:11,008 --> 00:28:15,200
any more than your skeleton, his bones

323
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,980
infested with cells.

324
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,264
The Earth is geological, yes.

325
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:27,220
But this geological entity

326
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,940
grows people.

327
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:35,642
And our existence on the Earth is a symptom of

328
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:38,030
the solar system and its balances.

329
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:42,074
As much as the solar system, in turn is a symptom

330
00:28:42,122 --> 00:28:45,914
of our galaxy. And our galaxy in its turn, is a symptom

331
00:28:45,962 --> 00:28:48,430
of the whole company of galaxies.

332
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,270
Goodness only knows what that's in.

333
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:57,310
But you see, when, as a scientist, you describe

334
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,250
the behavior of a living

335
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,230
organism,

336
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,890
you try to say what a person does. It's the only

337
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:12,870
way in which you can describe what a person is, describe what they do.

338
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,834
Then you find out that in making this description, you cannot

339
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:20,910
confine yourself to what happens inside the skin.

340
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,244
In other words, you can't talk about a person walking unless

341
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:30,132
you start describing the floor. Because when

342
00:29:30,156 --> 00:29:33,040
I walk, I don't just dangle my legs in empty space.

343
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,240
I move in relationship to a room.

344
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,244
And so in order to describe what I'm doing when I'm walking,

345
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:43,320
I have to describe the room. I have to describe the territory.

346
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,540
So in describing my talking at the moment,

347
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,352
I can't describe this just as a thing in itself because I'm talking to

348
00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:55,320
you. And so what I'm doing at the moment

349
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,064
is not completely described unless your being here is described

350
00:29:59,112 --> 00:30:02,664
also. So if that is necessary,

351
00:30:02,712 --> 00:30:06,888
if, in other words, in order to describe my behavior, I have to describe your

352
00:30:06,944 --> 00:30:10,520
behavior and the behavior of the environment, it means that we've really

353
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:16,040
got one system of behavior that

354
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,388
what I am involves

355
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:23,860
what you are. I don't know who I

356
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,732
am unless I know who you are. And you don't know

357
00:30:27,756 --> 00:30:31,732
who you are unless you know who I am. It was a wise rabbi

358
00:30:31,876 --> 00:30:35,092
once said, if I am I because you

359
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:38,292
are you, and you are you because I am I, then I am

360
00:30:38,316 --> 00:30:41,960
not I and you are not you. In other words, we are not separate.

361
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,440
We define each other. We're all backs and fronts to each other.

362
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,830
We and our environment and all of us and

363
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,382
each other are interdependent systems. We know

364
00:30:54,406 --> 00:30:58,318
who we are in terms of other people we all

365
00:30:58,374 --> 00:31:01,710
love together. And we

366
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,262
are, I think, quite urgent, in need of

367
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:09,470
coming to feel that we are the

368
00:31:09,510 --> 00:32:00,482
eternal universe. Each one of us sa a

369
00:32:00,506 --> 00:32:05,030
certain amount of doing nothing and stopping rushing around would

370
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,050
cool everything.

371
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:12,290
But also it must be remembered that passivity is the root of action.

372
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:18,010
Where do you suppose you're going to get energy from just by being energetic.

373
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,990
No, you can't get energy that way. That is

374
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:26,422
exhausting yourself. To have energy you

375
00:32:26,606 --> 00:32:30,150
must sleep. But also much

376
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,398
more important than sleep is passivity

377
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,010
of mind, mental silence.

378
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:42,398
You can't, as I tried to explain, be passive

379
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:46,270
as an exercise that's good for you. You can only

380
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:49,610
get to that point by realizing there's nothing else you can do.

381
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:55,502
So for God's sake, don't cultivate passivity as a form

382
00:32:55,526 --> 00:32:59,032
of progress. That's like playing, because it's good for

383
00:32:59,056 --> 00:33:01,976
your work. Also,

384
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:05,592
you get soft, you're not on the

385
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:09,000
key. Vi you develop flabby muscles because

386
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,740
you never get involved in a fight.

387
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,256
So the. What the Daoist tries

388
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:21,180
to develop is a sensibility to the situation.

389
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:27,270
He tries to feel out intuitively

390
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:33,270
what kind of action is required under these circumstances,

391
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:37,190
because he feels that he can never discover it analytically

392
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,550
with his conscious attention alone.

393
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,730
Well, now to talk in modern Western terms about how this is

394
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,826
done. We must realize, of course, that we are equipped

395
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:53,730
inside our heads with an absolutely fantastic

396
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,190
thing called the brain.

397
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,330
With its millions and millions of neuron

398
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,610
cells. It is, as it were, the most amazing

399
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,390
computer ever devised.

400
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:13,538
The basic to the Taoist attitude to life is

401
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:16,690
that you have that within you. And you may, if you don't know anything about

402
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:20,560
brains, though, very much, call it intuition or something of that kind.

403
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,132
But you have within you the most amazing logical

404
00:34:26,196 --> 00:34:29,588
analyzer that exists in the known

405
00:34:29,644 --> 00:34:33,124
world. And the point is to

406
00:34:33,132 --> 00:34:34,560
get it to work for you.

407
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,740
And instead of trying with conscious attention

408
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,468
alone, which can only think of about three things at a time without

409
00:34:44,524 --> 00:34:45,640
using a pencil,

410
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,760
that is to say, keep three variables in mind at once.

411
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,160
Very few people can do four without using a pencil.

412
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:59,300
You can do four if you're a trained musician, where you've got. You're playing four

413
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,596
different lines of a fugue. Say you're keeping four variables

414
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:06,100
in mind at once. With an organist you can go

415
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,708
from four to six because you've got your two feet

416
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:14,156
and they're playing too. But that requires

417
00:35:14,188 --> 00:35:18,108
a high amount of training to be able, with conscious attention,

418
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:21,548
to keep these many variables in mind.

419
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:25,260
But the world around us has infinitely many variables going

420
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,020
in it. And you can reason out something with

421
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,240
your conscious verbal thinking.

422
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,784
Say you want to make a contract in business and you figure

423
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,840
out how to make it, whether it will be a good contract, whether it will

424
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,248
work, etc. Etc. And you think of all these things and write

425
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:46,464
them down and you make the contract and you think that's fine. But one of

426
00:35:46,472 --> 00:35:50,160
the variables that you couldn't possibly include in the contract was that

427
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,020
your partner would slip on a banana skin and break his neck.

428
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,872
All sorts of things. I mean, the contract might make

429
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:03,534
provisions in it if your lawyer was thoughtful for what was to

430
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:06,878
be done under the case of the disability of any of the parties there too.

431
00:36:06,934 --> 00:36:10,782
Etc. But eventually there are so many possibilities

432
00:36:10,846 --> 00:36:13,370
that can occur that you cannot think of them all.

433
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,850
So then the question arises,

434
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:23,370
is it within the power of the human brain to

435
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:27,742
comprehend because of its immense complexity in

436
00:36:27,766 --> 00:36:31,040
a kind of un or subconscious way,

437
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,760
what the surface consciousness can never grasp?

438
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,120
And the. The Taoist would say, certainly it can,

439
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,588
that you've got to learn to use your brain by

440
00:36:43,644 --> 00:36:47,940
allowing it to go to work on your problems

441
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,492
without interfering with it, and then it will deliver you

442
00:36:51,516 --> 00:36:56,300
a decision. And this is why when

443
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:02,124
you get to. When you get to the real study of Taoist

444
00:37:02,172 --> 00:37:05,040
and Zen Buddhist practice,

445
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,440
you get to the point where you learn to act without making decisions.

446
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:17,120
Or rather, to use a more exact word, without choosing.

447
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,582
Krishnamurti talks a great deal about being choicelessly

448
00:37:22,646 --> 00:37:26,230
aware. And he says

449
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:29,690
freedom is precisely the state of not having to choose.

450
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,890
The only way to handle danger is to face it.

451
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,610
If you start getting frightened of it,

452
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,160
then you make it worse because you project onto it

453
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,952
all kinds of bogeys and threats which don't exist in it at all. Whenever you

454
00:37:55,976 --> 00:37:59,456
meet a ghost, don't run away because

455
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:02,688
the ghost will capture the substance of your

456
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:06,420
fear and materialize itself out of your own substance

457
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,272
and will kill you eventually because it will take over all

458
00:38:10,296 --> 00:38:13,354
your own vitality. So then,

459
00:38:13,442 --> 00:38:17,002
whenever confronted with a ghost, walk straight into it and

460
00:38:17,026 --> 00:38:21,230
it will disappear. We gotta survive.

461
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,626
You must survive. That's the great thing

462
00:38:25,698 --> 00:38:29,706
we're all working under and pounding it out day after day in

463
00:38:29,778 --> 00:38:33,310
anxiety. Because this is a description of anxiety.

464
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:37,146
Anxiety is the fear that one of a pair of opposites

465
00:38:37,178 --> 00:38:40,070
might cancel the other forever.

466
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,530
And if by any chance, by any means, you find out that that is not

467
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:50,242
so, you have an entirely new attitude to

468
00:38:50,266 --> 00:38:51,790
what human beings are doing,

469
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:57,122
which may be very creative, but which also may be

470
00:38:57,146 --> 00:39:00,866
very dangerous. You see

471
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:05,516
through the game. You are only

472
00:39:05,588 --> 00:39:09,084
just kidding that you're just poor little me. See, the function of

473
00:39:09,092 --> 00:39:12,440
a guru, that is to say a spiritual teacher in India,

474
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,460
is to look, give you a funny look in the eye because

475
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,600
you come to him and say, Mr. Guru, I have problems,

476
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:26,556
I suffer and it's a mess and I can't control my mind and I'm

477
00:39:26,588 --> 00:39:29,836
miserable and depressed and so on. And he gives you a funny

478
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:33,200
look, and you feel

479
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,576
a bit nervous about the way he looks at you because he thinks,

480
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:40,800
you know, he's reading your thoughts. And this man is a great magician.

481
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,864
He can read everything that's in you. He knows right down into your unconscious.

482
00:39:44,912 --> 00:39:48,896
And you know all the dreadful things you've thought and all the awful desires

483
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:52,032
you have. And you are rather embarrassed that this man looks right through you and

484
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,740
sees them all. But that's not what he's looking at.

485
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,870
He's giving you a funny look for quite another reason altogether,

486
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:04,442
because he sees in you the

487
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:06,670
Brahma, the Godhead,

488
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:11,162
just claiming it's poor little me. That's why he gives you

489
00:40:11,186 --> 00:40:14,650
a funny look and why he seems to see right through

490
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,114
you, as if to say,

491
00:40:17,202 --> 00:40:20,778
shiva, old boy, don't kid me, I know who you are.

492
00:40:20,914 --> 00:40:24,890
But you're coming on beautifully in this act that

493
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:28,170
you're somebody else altogether. And I

494
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:31,866
congratulate you. You're doing a wonderful job playing

495
00:40:31,938 --> 00:40:35,670
this part which you call the person, my person.

496
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:40,030
So it's all very well. Anybody can have ecstasy.

497
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:45,546
Anybody, as a matter of fact, can become aware

498
00:40:45,738 --> 00:40:49,070
that he is one with the eternal ground of the universe.

499
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:53,642
But since that what's what you are anyway, I going to ask,

500
00:40:53,746 --> 00:40:57,194
so what? When a hero

501
00:40:57,242 --> 00:41:00,922
goes on an adventure and he leaves his people and is

502
00:41:00,946 --> 00:41:04,394
going to a strange land, he can go away and just hide himself

503
00:41:04,442 --> 00:41:08,474
around the corner in an obscure house and then appear a year later

504
00:41:08,562 --> 00:41:11,850
and say, I've been on a heroic journey and tell all sorts of tales and

505
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:15,482
they say prove it, because they expect him

506
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:19,030
to bring back something, something which nobody has seen before.

507
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,910
Then they believe you've been on a journey.

508
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:26,194
So in the same way. Exactly. Anybody who goes on a spiritual

509
00:41:26,242 --> 00:41:28,670
journey must bring something back.

510
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:34,070
Because if you just say, oh man, it was a gas,

511
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,550
anyone can say that.

512
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:44,322
Now. This is why in the doctrines of Buddhism there

513
00:41:44,346 --> 00:41:48,170
is a differentiation between two kinds of enlightened Buddha beings.

514
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:53,446
They are both forms of Buddha, which is to say, the word Buddha

515
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:56,870
means somebody who has awakened, who has discovered the secret

516
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:00,822
behind all this. In other words, all this thing we call life with

517
00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:06,198
its frantic concerns, is a big act which

518
00:42:06,254 --> 00:42:09,462
you, in your unconscious death are deliberately

519
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:10,450
setting up.

520
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,968
So you can do one of two things. When you discover this, you can become

521
00:42:16,024 --> 00:42:20,020
what's called a Pratyaka Buddha, that means a private Buddha

522
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,220
who doesn't tell anything.

523
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,260
Or you can become a Bodhisattva,

524
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,360
practical Buddha goes off into his ecstasy and

525
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,104
never is seen again. Bodhisattva is come

526
00:42:35,192 --> 00:42:39,318
one who comes back and appears in the everyday world and

527
00:42:39,374 --> 00:42:43,254
plays the game of the everyday world by the rules of the everyday

528
00:42:43,302 --> 00:42:46,982
world. But he brings with him Upaya. He brings with

529
00:42:47,006 --> 00:42:50,342
him some way of showing that he's been on the journey,

530
00:42:50,486 --> 00:42:53,734
that he's come back. And he's going to let you in on the

531
00:42:53,742 --> 00:42:56,870
secret too. If you, if, if,

532
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:00,342
if you will play it cool and also come

533
00:43:00,366 --> 00:43:03,686
back to join in

534
00:43:03,758 --> 00:43:05,970
the everyday life of everyday people.

535
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,512
The first thing then is to discover what indeed you

536
00:43:12,536 --> 00:43:16,460
do love, if anything. And you will find there is something

537
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,100
and then go into the nature of that.

538
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,260
Now it said that selfish people love themselves

539
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,340
is something which you thought was other than yourself,

540
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:36,680
even if it be very ordinary things such as ice cream or

541
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,380
booze. In the

542
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,840
conventional sense, booze is not you,

543
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,644
nor is ice cream. It certainly it turns into you in a manner of speaking,

544
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:50,800
when you consume it, but then you don't have it anymore,

545
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,960
and so you look around for more in order to love it once again.

546
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,800
But so long as you love it, you see, it's never you.

547
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,340
When you love people, even however selfishly you love them because

548
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:09,500
of the pleasant sensations they give to you, still it is

549
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:13,372
somebody else that you love. And as you inquire

550
00:44:13,436 --> 00:44:17,484
into this, as you follow honestly your own selfishness,

551
00:44:17,612 --> 00:44:21,052
many interesting transformations begin to come about in you.

552
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:24,636
One of the most interesting transformations of being directly

553
00:44:24,668 --> 00:44:28,200
and honestly selfish in the same way that, for example, cats are,

554
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:30,950
is that you stop deceiving people.

555
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:37,850
If what you define as you is

556
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,590
inseparable from everything which you define as not you,

557
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:45,270
just as front is inseparable from back,

558
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,058
then you realize that deep down between self and other,

559
00:44:50,114 --> 00:44:51,870
there is some sort of conspiracy.

560
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:59,140
If these things always occur in combination and

561
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,920
look very different from each other and feel quite different,

562
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:08,724
nevertheless, the feeling of difference between them allows

563
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,280
each one to exist.

564
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,876
And so underneath the opposition or the polarity between

565
00:45:15,948 --> 00:45:19,818
self and other, or between any other pair of opposites you can think of,

566
00:45:20,004 --> 00:45:24,126
there is something in common, as there is, for example, between figure and

567
00:45:24,198 --> 00:45:28,158
background. You can't see a figure without

568
00:45:28,214 --> 00:45:31,850
a background. You can't have an organism without an environment.

569
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:36,126
Equally, you can't have a background without a figure or an environment,

570
00:45:36,278 --> 00:45:39,770
without organisms in it, or without things in it.

571
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:44,958
You can't have space which is unoccupied by any

572
00:45:45,014 --> 00:45:49,112
solid. You can cannot have solids not occupying

573
00:45:49,176 --> 00:45:52,940
some space. This is absolutely elementary

574
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,472
and yet we don't realize it because,

575
00:45:58,576 --> 00:46:02,300
for example, the average person thinks that space is nothing,

576
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,472
but it's just a sort of not thereness in which there

577
00:46:08,496 --> 00:46:13,070
are things and

578
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:16,710
we are slightly afraid that not thereness,

579
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:20,514
that nothingness, that darkness, that the negative polls

580
00:46:20,562 --> 00:46:22,590
of all these oppositions will win,

581
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:27,618
that they will eventually swallow up every kind of

582
00:46:27,674 --> 00:46:31,682
being and every kind of thereness. But when

583
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,990
you catch on to the game, you realize that that won't happen.

584
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:39,594
Because what is called not existing is quite

585
00:46:39,642 --> 00:46:43,498
incapable of being there without the contrast of something

586
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:44,590
called existing.

587
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:49,870
It's like the crest and the trough of a wave.

588
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:55,550
You can't have a wave that is all trough and no crest,

589
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:00,670
just as you can't have a wave which is all crest and no trough.

590
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,520
Such a thing has never been manifested in the physical universe.

591
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,120
They go together.

592
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,680
And that is the secret.

593
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:41,450
There really is no other secret than that.

594
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:27,842
That is the secret in

595
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:30,670
giving away the control. You got it.

596
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:36,070
You got the kind of control you wanted.

597
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:41,314
That's to say where you had a loving relationship

598
00:48:41,362 --> 00:48:44,642
to the world, but you

599
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:46,670
didn't have to make up your mind what it should do.

600
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:49,790
You let it decide.

601
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:58,870
Now do you see? That's how your bodies work.

602
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:05,434
You don't have to make up your mind what your nerve

603
00:49:05,482 --> 00:49:08,842
cells are going to do. You've delegated all

604
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:09,870
that authority.

605
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:15,896
If the President of the United States has to lay awake at nights thinking

606
00:49:15,928 --> 00:49:19,940
what every official under his command is going to do, he can't be president.

607
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,032
He's got to make an act of trust in all those subordinates

608
00:49:25,176 --> 00:49:28,312
to be responsible and carry on their things in just the same way as you

609
00:49:28,336 --> 00:49:32,056
make an act of trust to all your subordinate organs

610
00:49:32,248 --> 00:49:35,620
to carry on their functions without you having to tell them what to do.

611
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,580
And this is the secret of what we will call organic power

612
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:45,130
as distinct from political power.

613
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:51,614
Lao Tzu puts it in this way. The great Dao flows

614
00:49:51,662 --> 00:49:55,358
everywhere, both to the left and to the right. It loves

615
00:49:55,374 --> 00:49:58,366
and nourishes all things, but does not lord it over them.

616
00:49:58,518 --> 00:50:01,770
And when merits are accomplished, it lays no claim to them.

617
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:09,450
The more therefore you relinquish power,

618
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,848
trust others, the more

619
00:50:14,904 --> 00:50:17,580
powerful you become,

620
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,480
but in such a way that

621
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,220
instead of having to lie awake nights controlling everything,

622
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,900
you do it beautifully by trusting the job to everyone else.

623
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,060
They carry it on for you.

624
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:39,178
So you can go to sleep at night and trust your nervous system

625
00:50:39,234 --> 00:50:42,314
to wake you up in the morning. You can even tell it,

626
00:50:42,402 --> 00:50:44,954
I want to wake up at 6 o'clock and it'll wake you up just like

627
00:50:44,962 --> 00:50:46,030
an alarm clock.

628
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:52,186
This seems a sort of paradox to say this, but the principle

629
00:50:52,218 --> 00:50:53,230
of unity,

630
00:50:55,650 --> 00:51:00,138
of coming to a sense of of oneness with

631
00:51:00,194 --> 00:51:04,298
the whole of the rest of the universe is not to try to obtain

632
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,738
power over the rest of the universe. That will only

633
00:51:07,794 --> 00:51:11,082
disturb it and antagonize it and make it

634
00:51:11,106 --> 00:51:15,470
seem less one with you than ever. The way to become one with the universe

635
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:20,746
is to trust it as

636
00:51:20,818 --> 00:51:23,350
another, as you would another,

637
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:27,386
and say, let's see what you're

638
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:28,150
going to do.

639
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:32,330
This seminar about birth, death and the unborn

640
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:36,230
is going to be a discussion of the Buddhist philosophy of

641
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:40,598
change. And I'm going to start out by going

642
00:52:40,654 --> 00:52:44,770
into the very tricky and difficult question

643
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,850
of the Buddhist view of birth and death.

644
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:53,556
And the doctrine which is ordinarily understood as reincarnation

645
00:52:53,668 --> 00:52:54,920
or rebirth.

646
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,364
It's a curious thing that

647
00:53:01,452 --> 00:53:04,772
many Westerners who become interested in Hinduism or

648
00:53:04,796 --> 00:53:09,028
Buddhism do so because of

649
00:53:09,084 --> 00:53:13,620
this idea of reincarnation they

650
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:13,860
like,

651
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,580
gives a more satisfactory vision of

652
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:24,960
individual history and development than

653
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:28,900
the two possibilities that would normally be open to Westerners to believe

654
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:32,720
in. On the one hand,

655
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:37,332
you've got the choice of the Christian view,

656
00:53:37,516 --> 00:53:40,640
which is that you live in this world once,

657
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,652
and in this four score years and ten, your eternal fate is

658
00:53:44,676 --> 00:53:48,412
settled, or you've got the possibility of

659
00:53:48,436 --> 00:53:51,708
the materialistic view, which is that you only live

660
00:53:51,764 --> 00:53:55,852
once and when you're dead, you're dead. That's that you're a flash

661
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:58,800
of consciousness between two eternal darknesses.

662
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:03,996
Intelligent people in the Western world have never felt very happy about either

663
00:54:04,028 --> 00:54:07,606
of these two prospects. And therefore there's

664
00:54:07,638 --> 00:54:11,206
a certain attractiveness about the idea, which seems

665
00:54:11,238 --> 00:54:15,270
to be the point of Buddhism and Hinduism, that you are

666
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:19,158
a soul on a pilgrimage. And that from

667
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:23,238
some extremely obscure origin, you began as some sort

668
00:54:23,254 --> 00:54:27,478
of animalcule and worked your way up, step by step,

669
00:54:27,534 --> 00:54:31,670
through all sorts of forms of life. And finally you

670
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:34,370
have the privilege of appearing in human form.

671
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:42,670
And once you've got there, you have an opportunity to

672
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:45,610
develop to the highest spiritual position.

673
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:49,890
You must remember that according to both Hindu and Buddhist doctrines,

674
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:53,850
the human form is a very privileged position.

675
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:59,730
For there are, according to both of them, because they share a common cosmology,

676
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,600
six domains of beings.

677
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:08,164
And if you visualize the

678
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:12,004
wheel of life with its six divisions,

679
00:55:12,052 --> 00:55:15,668
at the highest top division, there is the realm

680
00:55:15,764 --> 00:55:19,124
of the deva. Deva is a word

681
00:55:19,172 --> 00:55:23,080
from which we get the word divine and equally the word devil.

682
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,780
A deva means, though originally a God, or more

683
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,892
correctly, an angel. Angel is a

684
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:33,840
better Western translation of deva than God.

685
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,732
Immediately opposite the deva world, at the bottom

686
00:55:38,876 --> 00:55:42,300
of the circle, there is the Naraka world of

687
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:46,140
beings in torment. This is the dimension of the world, which is the

688
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:50,124
screaming mimis. Which is experience in the form of absolute

689
00:55:50,172 --> 00:55:54,172
horror. The deva world is the experience

690
00:55:54,276 --> 00:55:56,560
of being in the form of bliss.

691
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,896
And between these two poles there are all kinds of ranges.

692
00:56:02,088 --> 00:56:05,832
There are, for example, the Ashuras next to the devas,

693
00:56:05,976 --> 00:56:09,820
going clockwise around the wheel, and the Asuras,

694
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,064
they are a wrathful beings.

695
00:56:13,192 --> 00:56:16,620
Ashura is the incarnation of divine anger.

696
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,980
Then next to the Asura, going around, are the animals,

697
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,624
all animals whatsoever. Then again, we get to the Naraka at the

698
00:56:26,632 --> 00:56:30,384
bottom, the place of the Purgatory, we'll call it.

699
00:56:30,552 --> 00:56:34,160
Then coming up again, there's the world of the Preta,

700
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,488
who are frustrated beings.

701
00:56:37,664 --> 00:56:41,008
And they're represented iconographically as having

702
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,592
very large bellies and very tiny mouths, that is to

703
00:56:44,616 --> 00:56:47,920
say, an immense appetite with very

704
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,214
little means of satisfying it. They are a sort of spiritual

705
00:56:51,262 --> 00:56:54,798
bottleneck. And then coming

706
00:56:54,854 --> 00:56:58,638
up between the pretas and the devas is the world

707
00:56:58,694 --> 00:57:02,782
of the humans. And this is understood to represent

708
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:04,330
a sort of middle position.

709
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:10,638
You can be liberated from the human state because

710
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:13,810
the devas are too happy to be liberated,

711
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:18,372
the Asuras too furious, the animals too dumb,

712
00:57:18,516 --> 00:57:22,360
the Narakas too tormented and the pretas too frustrated.

713
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:28,932
You need not take this as a literal account

714
00:57:29,036 --> 00:57:32,548
of various kinds of being in the universe. You can take them

715
00:57:32,604 --> 00:57:35,840
simply as a depiction of various states of the human mind,

716
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,400
of the moods you can go through.

717
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:43,822
They're all really in your own head, as we shall see later on,

718
00:57:43,846 --> 00:57:47,150
about many other things. But these

719
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:51,330
are the six worlds of Hindu and Buddhist cosmology,

720
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:55,198
and the notion is that one reincarnates again

721
00:57:55,254 --> 00:57:58,878
and again through the six worlds. This is the popular idea.

722
00:57:59,054 --> 00:58:02,478
In other words, if you live this human life

723
00:58:02,534 --> 00:58:06,780
in a bad way and you become angry,

724
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,352
if you devote your life to fury, you'll be reincarnated as

725
00:58:11,376 --> 00:58:14,580
an Ashura. If you devote your life to

726
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,728
merely living for back and belly, you'll be reincarnated

727
00:58:18,824 --> 00:58:22,664
as an animal. If you are horribly cruel

728
00:58:22,712 --> 00:58:26,040
to people, you'll be reincarnated as a Naraka,

729
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,448
and so on all around. But on the other hand, if you do good

730
00:58:29,504 --> 00:58:32,590
things in the because of your

731
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:36,014
karma, you will be reincarnated in the Deva world,

732
00:58:36,182 --> 00:58:39,130
or in better and better situations in the human world.

733
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:44,894
That's the popular understanding. And Westerners, many of

734
00:58:44,902 --> 00:58:49,182
them, think, well, that's great, because this opens up vast vistas

735
00:58:49,326 --> 00:58:53,294
of future development. We can go on in future lives

736
00:58:53,382 --> 00:58:57,026
working out our destinies. And we can also love to think about.

737
00:58:57,078 --> 00:59:00,794
About who we were before. When you fall in

738
00:59:00,802 --> 00:59:04,394
love with somebody, did you meet before in some Past life

739
00:59:04,482 --> 00:59:07,322
is this the working out of a karma that is between you?

740
00:59:07,426 --> 00:59:11,390
And it's very interesting. But the funny thing is that Hindus and Buddhists

741
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:15,002
who do believe in rebirth do so not

742
00:59:15,026 --> 00:59:18,762
because they like it, but because they feel they have to accept it

743
00:59:18,786 --> 00:59:22,870
as a hard fact. And the whole task of the work of

744
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:27,252
sadhana, or a spiritual practice and discipline is

745
00:59:27,276 --> 00:59:30,788
to get out of it. So it always

746
00:59:30,844 --> 00:59:34,164
strikes me. It's very funny that Westerners

747
00:59:34,212 --> 00:59:38,276
take this up because they find it comforting, but Easterners

748
00:59:38,468 --> 00:59:41,160
are always trying to get away from being reborn.

749
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:47,732
It was so funny once Joseph Campbell told me a story that

750
00:59:47,756 --> 00:59:50,920
he was sitting with a Vedanta swami,

751
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,680
one of these Vedanta Society swamis.

752
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:58,960
And the swami was saying, oh, dear me. He said, you know,

753
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:04,340
really, the idea of rebirth is so wonderful. Said I.

754
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:07,652
I really. I think this is

755
01:00:07,676 --> 01:00:10,760
the. The most. The most comforting notion.

756
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:15,208
And Joe said to him, swami, don't be a damn

757
01:00:15,284 --> 01:00:18,816
fool. What are you talking about? The idea

758
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:20,900
of rebirth being so comfortable.

759
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,180
Don't you realize that that's what you're supposed to get away from?

760
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,300
And the swami suddenly jumped, said, oh, yes, of course.

761
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,832
It was like I once had a talk with a swami, and he

762
01:00:36,856 --> 01:00:40,592
was arguing, you see, that behind all the multiple forms of this

763
01:00:40,616 --> 01:00:44,034
world, there was only one single

764
01:00:44,162 --> 01:00:47,570
divine principle. And he was going on about

765
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:51,378
this. I said, swami, you can't talk like that. You know very well

766
01:00:51,434 --> 01:00:54,590
that the Brahman, the ultimate reality, isn't one,

767
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:58,898
because one has an opposite, which is many, and Brahman has no opposite.

768
01:00:58,994 --> 01:01:01,670
You should speak as Brahman as the non dual.

769
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:04,710
And again, you talk just like a Hindu.

770
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:12,716
They're funny, you see, because these swamis have accepted an enormous

771
01:01:12,748 --> 01:01:16,204
amount of Western feeling, how the British

772
01:01:16,252 --> 01:01:20,556
were responsible for that, for occupying India so long and perverting

773
01:01:20,588 --> 01:01:21,520
its traditions.

774
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:29,260
Now it is so curious, all this, because in Buddhism there

775
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,998
still prevails an idea of rebirth very

776
01:01:33,054 --> 01:01:35,650
strong among all Buddhist countries.

777
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:40,182
And yet Buddhism explicitly

778
01:01:40,246 --> 01:01:44,630
denies that there is any individual reincarnating

779
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:48,822
soul. You see, in Buddhism there

780
01:01:48,846 --> 01:01:51,730
is a doctrine which is called the three signs of being.

781
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:55,606
I should more correctly say the Sanskrit word is bhava,

782
01:01:55,718 --> 01:01:59,664
vhava, and that means becoming rather than being.

783
01:01:59,862 --> 01:02:02,924
Bhava is from the basic root,

784
01:02:02,972 --> 01:02:06,796
I think, bh, which is connected with the.

785
01:02:06,868 --> 01:02:11,180
With growth. So bhava,

786
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:14,780
becoming, the process of change has

787
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:19,280
three signs. One is called dukkha.

788
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:24,652
D u h K H A dukta in

789
01:02:24,676 --> 01:02:26,320
Sanskrit means frustration,

790
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:30,210
sometimes translated suffering.

791
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:35,246
But I think frustration is a more general

792
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:39,646
word which is perhaps better. It's dukkha

793
01:02:39,758 --> 01:02:43,810
is the opposite of sukkah. Sukkah means sweet.

794
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:48,382
Dukkha perhaps means sour. But in

795
01:02:48,406 --> 01:02:51,630
this, in the way it's used, it means frustration as

796
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:54,140
a basic characteristic of living beings.

797
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,112
Because for some reason or other, life is always eventually

798
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:03,060
frustrating. You desire more than you can ever get.

799
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,700
You overreach the possibilities.

800
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,500
And so to every being, death comes as a collapse

801
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,220
and as something unfortunate.

802
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,882
The next sign of being is called anita A n

803
01:03:20,906 --> 01:03:25,830
I t y a in Sanskrit, anitya, which means impermanence,

804
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:30,230
the opposite word being, nitya, eternal.

805
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:34,242
So anitya is everything is

806
01:03:34,266 --> 01:03:38,130
in flux. And finally,

807
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:41,922
anatman, A n a T M a N,

808
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:45,756
anatman, which means that nothing has

809
01:03:45,828 --> 01:03:47,120
its own soul.

810
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:55,132
Now that sounds to a Christian a

811
01:03:55,156 --> 01:03:58,860
terrible idea, because we use the word

812
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:02,668
soulless, or we say to a person, you have no soul,

813
01:04:02,844 --> 01:04:05,948
which means you have no finer feelings. You have no,

814
01:04:06,004 --> 01:04:09,900
you're not a human being. Because Christian theology

815
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:13,972
did distinguish between humans and animals by saying that animals have no

816
01:04:13,996 --> 01:04:17,720
soul. Idiots have no soul. They've lost their soul.

817
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:21,972
But you can see at once that there is a complete difference

818
01:04:22,116 --> 01:04:25,940
of the meaning. This is a. To translate atman as

819
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:27,480
soul is ridiculous.

820
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:35,240
Anatman means basically

821
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:38,520
that nothing exists.

822
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:43,292
Well, there's another word in Sanskrit

823
01:04:43,356 --> 01:04:47,164
you have to know, svaphava sva, that means

824
01:04:47,332 --> 01:04:51,040
oneself or one's own, same as the Latin sus,

825
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:54,924
because the V becomes the U sva

826
01:04:55,052 --> 01:04:58,492
bava bhava, becoming again, your own becoming,

827
01:04:58,636 --> 01:05:02,000
or sometimes it's called your own nature or self nature.

828
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:06,610
So what it is saying is that you don't. That nothing has

829
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:10,090
any real swabhava,

830
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:15,446
because no individual thing

831
01:05:15,518 --> 01:05:19,382
of any kind exists except in relation to all the

832
01:05:19,406 --> 01:05:20,210
other things.

833
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:27,090
In other words, you are what you are

834
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:30,890
only because of your relationships to everything else.

835
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:36,080
And therefore the whole universe is a system of interdependence.

836
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:40,492
It's just as if, for example, you were to stand two sticks on the

837
01:05:40,516 --> 01:05:44,460
ground and lean them against each other, and they will stand up

838
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:48,028
and form an inverted V because

839
01:05:48,084 --> 01:05:49,560
they lean on each other.

840
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:54,668
And this is an old thing that they teach children in

841
01:05:54,724 --> 01:05:58,348
Japan, that these sticks leaning against each other form

842
01:05:58,404 --> 01:06:01,520
the Chinese character for man. And they

843
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:05,340
say, therefore, man cannot exist unless we support each other.

844
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,808
This is the basis, therefore, of brotherhood and of good

845
01:06:09,864 --> 01:06:13,312
social relationships. But underneath that is

846
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:16,700
the far more profound idea that

847
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:20,980
the universe coheres

848
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,180
by everything depending on everything else.

849
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:29,898
And therefore nothing exists alone,

850
01:06:30,074 --> 01:06:33,802
nothing exists in its own right. And that's what anatman

851
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:37,930
means. You do not have an indestructible

852
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:41,114
immortal soul, which is just plain you forever

853
01:06:41,162 --> 01:06:44,906
and ever and ever, and is independent of there being anything else

854
01:06:44,938 --> 01:06:45,670
at all.

855
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:52,170
Also, though, this does go along with the idea that there is not some kind

856
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:56,162
of gaseous spook, some kind of etheric double

857
01:06:56,226 --> 01:07:00,162
astral body what have you, which outlasts the

858
01:07:00,186 --> 01:07:03,986
existence of the physical body and migrates

859
01:07:04,018 --> 01:07:05,510
to the next incarnation.

860
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:12,706
So it has always been a puzzle for Buddhist philosophers to explain

861
01:07:12,818 --> 01:07:16,114
how they can at once believe in reincarnation and at the

862
01:07:16,122 --> 01:07:19,758
same time deny the existence of an individual spooky,

863
01:07:19,884 --> 01:07:23,790
which is independent of the physical frame.

864
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:29,306
And the most subtle discussions in all Buddhist literature range

865
01:07:29,338 --> 01:07:33,002
around this puzzle. The most important

866
01:07:33,106 --> 01:07:36,810
text of early Buddhism is a book called the Questions of

867
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:40,938
King Melinda. This is the Greek Menanda.

868
01:07:41,114 --> 01:07:44,310
He is a king in the succession of Alexander the Great,

869
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:48,756
who ruled in Alexander's eastern empire and

870
01:07:48,828 --> 01:07:52,920
had long conversations with a Buddhist sage by the name of Nagasena.

871
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:57,140
And Nagasena tries to explain to the king how

872
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:00,760
there can be rebirth without anyone who is being reborn.

873
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:04,680
And so this is the problem to which we address ourselves.

874
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:08,240
How can there be a continuing process

875
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:12,572
without anything carried along by

876
01:08:12,596 --> 01:08:15,740
it? And you will recognize at once that the problem is

877
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:21,160
very largely semantic because

878
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:25,120
it involves our whole idea of continuity.

879
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:30,560
What, for example, do you mean by a wave?

880
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,980
When you see you throw a stone into the water, and from

881
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:39,217
the plop point where the stone goes in, a whole

882
01:08:39,233 --> 01:08:42,909
lot of rings emerge and they are waves and they go out,

883
01:08:44,089 --> 01:08:47,969
and you can, as it were, look at one of them and

884
01:08:48,009 --> 01:08:52,149
follow it. And you say, I am watching a wave.

885
01:08:54,329 --> 01:08:55,989
But what is a wave?

886
01:08:57,529 --> 01:09:00,609
You know very well that the

887
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:01,749
water itself,

888
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:07,052
no, no volume of water, no specific volume of water,

889
01:09:07,156 --> 01:09:10,320
is moving outwards from the place where you drop the pebble.

890
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:17,452
The water is staying quite still so far

891
01:09:17,476 --> 01:09:21,244
as lateral motion is concerned, but the water is moving

892
01:09:21,292 --> 01:09:25,356
up and down. And these up and down movements create

893
01:09:25,428 --> 01:09:29,320
the illusion of a thing called a wave that goes along.

894
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:34,240
Similar to the illusion when you watch a barber's pole revolving.

895
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:37,852
It seems to be a procession of something that

896
01:09:37,876 --> 01:09:40,520
keeps going up from the bottom of the pole to the top.

897
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:43,080
But actually it's just going around.

898
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:49,036
Now that that appearance of

899
01:09:49,108 --> 01:09:52,732
something moving when there is actually the only thing

900
01:09:52,756 --> 01:09:56,166
that is going outwards is motion.

901
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:59,410
And motion is about as abstract as you can think.

902
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:03,670
This is the whole root of the Indian

903
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:06,970
idea of Maya, of the world as Maya,

904
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:11,782
as a construct, as something which,

905
01:10:11,886 --> 01:10:16,390
shall we say, exists only in your mind only.

906
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:20,422
We shall have to be very careful what

907
01:10:20,446 --> 01:10:23,792
we mean by that. And I'm going to come to

908
01:10:23,816 --> 01:10:25,860
that later on in the sermon.

909
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,380
So here. Here is. Here is the point.

910
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:38,500
You are delivered from rebirth.

911
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:43,312
This being the purpose of the spiritual disciplines of

912
01:10:43,336 --> 01:10:46,928
Hinduism and Buddhism. As soon as you

913
01:10:46,984 --> 01:10:51,400
are relieved of the illusion that something is going on,

914
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:56,700
continuity. This, after this, after this,

915
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:59,760
after this, all linking up together into a chain.

916
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:04,508
In the famous Zen text called the Platform Sutra,

917
01:11:04,604 --> 01:11:07,360
attributed to Hui Nun, the sixth patriarch,

918
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:11,820
there is a passage which says, if we

919
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:15,830
allow our thoughts, past, present and future to

920
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:19,610
link up into a series, we put ourselves under restraint.

921
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:24,870
But on the other hand, if we just see that they are not

922
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:28,502
they, there is just this thought and then this thought and then this thought.

923
01:11:28,686 --> 01:11:30,010
You are liberated.

924
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:36,422
This is an idea which is taken up by T.S. eliot in his poem the

925
01:11:36,446 --> 01:11:40,134
Four Quartets, where you come to the passage

926
01:11:40,182 --> 01:11:45,470
where he says that you're getting on a train and

927
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:49,890
you settle down in the compartment with your newspaper

928
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:53,710
and you're going on a journey. But the one

929
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:56,942
who arrives at the destination will not be the same person

930
01:11:57,126 --> 01:11:59,250
who left the platform in the beginning,

931
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:05,982
because you who sit here now are

932
01:12:06,006 --> 01:12:09,230
not the same as the people who came in at the door a little

933
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:12,542
while ago. Just in exactly the

934
01:12:12,566 --> 01:12:16,526
same way as the flame of a candle appears

935
01:12:16,558 --> 01:12:19,742
to be a constant flame, which we can identify as a

936
01:12:19,766 --> 01:12:24,170
thing, but as a matter of fact, it is a stream of

937
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:26,330
hot energy,

938
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:31,582
which is whatever particles,

939
01:12:31,646 --> 01:12:35,620
whatever gaseous the molecules are here are going

940
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,900
like this the whole time, flowing upwards and disappearing.

941
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,860
The flame is converting the candle wax into gas.

942
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,432
And in exactly the same way as we can see that the flame has

943
01:12:49,456 --> 01:12:52,984
an identity. You say it is a flame. We have a noun

944
01:12:53,032 --> 01:12:56,860
for it, where actually it is a process, it is flaming.

945
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,906
And so in just precisely that way, it. Every human

946
01:13:00,978 --> 01:13:03,430
being is a process.

947
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:07,870
Just as the flame is the conversion of wax into gas,

948
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:11,898
so you and I are the conversion of

949
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:15,950
air and water and light and beef steak and milk

950
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:20,250
into and

951
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:23,786
which again converts into something else. You see, we are the

952
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:27,284
flowing vibration through which all this goes,

953
01:13:27,332 --> 01:13:30,240
and not for one moment are we the same.

954
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:35,240
So then the meaning of the Buddhist doctrine

955
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:41,748
is that you who

956
01:13:41,804 --> 01:13:43,720
live today are never going to die,

957
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:50,080
because the one that's going to die will not be the youth here now.

958
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:54,530
And likewise, the one that's here now was never born.

959
01:13:57,590 --> 01:14:01,582
It goes like this. It is explained by Dogen,

960
01:14:01,726 --> 01:14:05,646
who was the most fabulous Zen philosopher living around

961
01:14:05,718 --> 01:14:14,670
1200 AD when he said the

962
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:18,600
spring does not become the summer

963
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,020
and the summer does not become autumn.

964
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:25,528
No one would say that spring becomes the summer.

965
01:14:25,704 --> 01:14:28,700
There is spring and then there is Summer.

966
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,500
And he said, in the same way, when you burn wood,

967
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,940
there are ashes, but the wood does not become the ashes.

968
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,220
There is wood and then there is ashes.

969
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:48,670
Each is, as it were,

970
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:52,386
sufficient to itself. There are, as it were,

971
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:56,070
so steps. It's like vibrations,

972
01:14:56,810 --> 01:14:59,390
wave crests. You see,

973
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:02,946
where the water

974
01:15:03,018 --> 01:15:06,710
doesn't move, you see, water doesn't move laterally.

975
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:11,502
So in this sense, by analogy, the spring does not become the

976
01:15:11,526 --> 01:15:15,198
summer, but by watching it,

977
01:15:15,254 --> 01:15:18,942
you in your mind impose motion on

978
01:15:18,966 --> 01:15:22,542
the up and down of the water. And so you say the

979
01:15:22,566 --> 01:15:26,574
spring becomes the summer. So likewise you say the baby

980
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:29,534
becomes the adolescent, becomes the man,

981
01:15:29,622 --> 01:15:32,050
becomes the crone, becomes the corpse.

982
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:37,220
And the Buddhists say, no. These states follow

983
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,940
in the same way as the apparent motion of a wave.

984
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,528
And so the,

985
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:51,720
the. The word to the wise is live

986
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,952
the moment you're in, there is

987
01:15:54,976 --> 01:15:58,408
no other place to be. You will not

988
01:15:58,464 --> 01:16:00,380
die, and you were never born.

989
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,300
If you realize, if you see through the illusion

990
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,872
now, this may sound as if one were creating a theory of the

991
01:16:12,896 --> 01:16:16,120
universe, which is what you might

992
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,500
call atomistic,

993
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:24,460
discontinuous. It is saying the universe is nothing,

994
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,220
but what point instance?

995
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,992
And it all comes down to that. See, this is an

996
01:16:33,016 --> 01:16:35,700
extension of the Western philosophy of nominalism.

997
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,580
Nominalism is opposed to realism. The nominalists

998
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:45,280
argue against the realists point of view, which is,

999
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:48,500
realists say there is such a thing as mankind.

1000
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:53,158
Mankind is a reality, and every

1001
01:16:53,214 --> 01:16:57,030
individual human is a special instance of

1002
01:16:57,070 --> 01:17:00,890
a real universal substance

1003
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:05,094
called man. The nominalists

1004
01:17:05,142 --> 01:17:08,950
argue this is abstraction and nonsense. There is no such thing as

1005
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:11,650
mankind. There are only individual people.

1006
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:17,142
And of course, this has become, in the 20th century, the ascendant point of

1007
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:20,688
view. There is not really such a thing as the United States

1008
01:17:20,744 --> 01:17:24,112
of America. That is a political abstraction. There are

1009
01:17:24,136 --> 01:17:25,660
just the people who live here.

1010
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:32,260
But if you take nominalism to its logical conclusion,

1011
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:35,580
you get to the point where you don't exist at all.

1012
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:39,552
A human being. Well, there is no such thing as a human being. It's an

1013
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:43,620
abstraction. All there is is the molecules that are the cells

1014
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:45,330
which infest your bones.
