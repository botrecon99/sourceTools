1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,872
Supposing the water at each place where a finger of

2
00:00:10,896 --> 00:00:14,536
water stretches out over dry ground and doesn't go any further

3
00:00:14,608 --> 00:00:18,472
because the land is too high. The water were to say

4
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:22,580
to itself, I failed. We would say it was neurotic water.

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,150
Just wait and it will find a way.

6
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,738
Now, when you find you see that there's this predicament

7
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:38,750
that I've been describing to you,

8
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:46,962
that there's no way of transforming yourself to

9
00:00:46,986 --> 00:00:50,370
become this fearless, joyous,

10
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,150
divine being as distinct from the quaking mass.

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,680
When you say no way,

12
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,380
this is not a

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,280
gloomy announcement.

14
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,764
It is a very, very important communication telling

15
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:18,400
something.

16
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,332
Because the. Like the land is telling the water. This isn't the

17
00:01:24,356 --> 00:01:25,240
way to go.

18
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,972
There's another way. Cry over here. So in the

19
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:34,360
same way, life is telling you that's not the way to go,

20
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,732
it's telling you the.

21
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:44,720
The message underlying this is you cannot transform yourself,

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,220
is giving you the message that

23
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,560
the you that you imagine to be capable of

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,060
transforming yourself doesn't exist.

25
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,550
In other words, an ego and

26
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,582
I separate

27
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:21,730
from my emotions, my thoughts, my feelings, my experiences.

28
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,286
Who is supposed to be in control of. Cannot control

29
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:28,250
them because it isn't there.

30
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,562
And as soon as you understand that, things will be

31
00:02:38,586 --> 00:02:39,910
vastly improved.

32
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,310
Now we can go into this. What do you mean

33
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,790
by the word I?

34
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,930
We're going to make some experiments in this on some number

35
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,670
of different levels, but the ordinary way. What do you mean by the word I?

36
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,938
I myself. Your personality,

37
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:06,360
your ego. What is it?

38
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,760
Well, first of all, obviously, it's your image of yourself.

39
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,652
It's composed of what people have told you about yourself,

40
00:03:20,716 --> 00:03:24,300
who you are, how they've reacted to you and given you an impression that

41
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,200
that's the sort of person you are.

42
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,556
It's all your education goes into this, the style

43
00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:32,640
of life you put on and so forth.

44
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,860
But it's an image, it's an idea, it's your thought about

45
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,520
yourself. And I suppose yourself is in

46
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,472
fact not this, but is to

47
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:49,020
begin with your total physical organism,

48
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,300
your psychological organism.

49
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,500
And beyond that,

50
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,880
an organism doesn't exist as an

51
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,108
isolated thing any more than a flower exists without

52
00:04:05,164 --> 00:04:07,560
a stalk, without roots, without earth.

53
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,828
So in the same way, although we are not stalked on the ground,

54
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:16,000
we are nevertheless inseparable from

55
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:23,124
a huge social context of.

56
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:25,000
Well, to begin with, parents,

57
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,516
siblings, people who work for us, everything. I mean, it's.

58
00:04:30,548 --> 00:04:33,794
It's just impossible to cut ourselves off from a

59
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:36,882
social environment and also furthermore, from a

60
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:40,030
natural environment. We are that.

61
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,242
There's no clear way of drawing the boundary between this organism

62
00:04:44,386 --> 00:04:48,082
and everything that surrounds it. And yet the image of ourselves

63
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:51,330
that we have does not include all

64
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,790
those relationships.

65
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,150
The point, though, is,

66
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,316
with all this, the first thing we have to understand is

67
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,280
what I will call deep listening.

68
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,596
And very few people ever really listen because

69
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:15,052
instead of receiving the sound, they make comments on it

70
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:18,360
all the time they're thinking about it.

71
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,840
And so the sound is never fully heard.

72
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,256
You just have to let it take over, let it take you over

73
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:27,220
completely.

74
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,100
Then you get the samadhi state of becoming it.

75
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,680
And it

76
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,860
also means that you abandon

77
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,020
your socially nervous personality.

78
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,250
Well, one of the reasons why people don't sing

79
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,702
is that they hear so many masters on records and

80
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:03,910
they're ashamed of their own voices and

81
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,610
think, there's no point singing unless I'm good at it.

82
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,094
Well, that's like saying there's no point my doing anything at all unless

83
00:06:13,142 --> 00:06:17,370
I'm particularly gifted at it, which is ridiculous.

84
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:28,950
But singing is

85
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,290
of course, very good for you. But we won't mention that

86
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,570
as it brings in too much purposiveness into it.

87
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,838
It's like a child will make

88
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:46,870
noises because of the absorbing interest of making noises.

89
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,250
It embarrasses the hell out of some people.

90
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,090
You say, what are you laughing at?

91
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,180
Sa.

92
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,450
Give me some of that. Give me some of that.

93
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,246
The title of these talks that I'm giving here is Mind Over

94
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:01,930
Mind.

95
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,632
And I'm going into all

96
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:12,200
the various problems which have to do with

97
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,940
the control of the mind.

98
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,960
So it all comes down to this basic question that

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,944
human beings have

100
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:27,416
for a long, long time been concerned about transforming

101
00:08:27,448 --> 00:08:28,620
their minds.

102
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,830
Is there any way in which one's mind can be transformed?

103
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:41,590
Or is it simply a process which is nothing more than a vicious circle?

104
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,390
I could ask, why have you come here this afternoon?

105
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,562
What were you looking for? Would it

106
00:08:52,586 --> 00:08:55,972
be too presumptuous of me to say that you were

107
00:08:55,996 --> 00:08:59,940
looking for help? That you

108
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,160
hoped you would hear somebody who had something to say

109
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,740
that would be of help and relevance to

110
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,148
you as members of a

111
00:09:12,204 --> 00:09:16,360
world which is running into the most intense difficulty.

112
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,702
And one naturally says the reason

113
00:09:22,806 --> 00:09:26,734
why we are in such a mess is not simply

114
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:29,930
that we have wrong systems for doing things,

115
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,330
but we have the wrong people.

116
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,262
The systems may be all right, but they are in the wrong

117
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:42,302
hands. Because we are all,

118
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:46,350
in various ways, self seeking, lacking in

119
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,128
wisdom, lacking in courage,

120
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:52,060
afraid of death, afraid of pain,

121
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,300
unwilling really to cooperate with others,

122
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,624
unwilling to be open to others. And we all think that's

123
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:02,936
too bad. If only I could be the right person.

124
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:07,016
I would like to improve so in so many people's

125
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:09,740
minds and from so many different angles,

126
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,976
there is this urgent feeling that I must

127
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,300
improve me.

128
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,456
Now in this question, can I

129
00:10:21,608 --> 00:10:25,232
improve me? There is the obvious

130
00:10:25,296 --> 00:10:28,752
difficulty that if I am in need of improvement,

131
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:32,112
the person who's going to do the improving is the

132
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:35,808
one who needs to be improved. And there

133
00:10:35,864 --> 00:10:38,420
immediately we have a vicious circle.

134
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,628
And so I might introduce what I'm going to say

135
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,680
by saying it from different points of view.

136
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,080
For example, if you're interested in communications,

137
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,970
it will be the problem of feedback.

138
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,330
Or if I may put it in theological terms,

139
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,262
how does man follow the will of God? If the

140
00:11:17,286 --> 00:11:19,490
will of man is perverse,

141
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,170
how then do you get grace?

142
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,890
Why is grace given to some and not to others?

143
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,462
If I cannot follow the will of God by my own effort,

144
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:37,660
because my will is selfish, how will my

145
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,940
will which is selfish be transformed into

146
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,600
an unselfish will? If I cannot do it,

147
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,972
then grace must do it. If grace

148
00:11:49,036 --> 00:11:51,400
has not already done it, why not?

149
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,600
Because I didn't accept it.

150
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,180
But by definition I had no power to accept it because my will

151
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,364
was selfish. Must I then become a Calvinist

152
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:07,620
and say that only those people who

153
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,020
are predestined to receive grace will be able to

154
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,000
live the good life?

155
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,132
Then we come back to

156
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:25,780
the inadmissible position that

157
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,300
people who live evil lives and do not get grace

158
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,526
because they are not predestined to it out of the infinite wisdom

159
00:12:33,558 --> 00:12:37,494
of the Godhead, then God himself must be held responsible for their evil

160
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:38,250
deeds.

161
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,170
People fall from grace.

162
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,574
Why do they? You see, we're just talking about the same old problem,

163
00:12:51,742 --> 00:12:54,930
but we've put it a step up. But it's the same problem.

164
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,020
How can I improve myself?

165
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,264
Was the first problem. The second problem is how can I accept grace?

166
00:13:05,312 --> 00:13:08,940
They're both the same problem, because you've got to make a move

167
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,272
which will put yourself out of your own control into the

168
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:18,192
control of a better. If you

169
00:13:18,216 --> 00:13:21,696
don't believe in the Christian kind of a God, you can believe in the Hindu

170
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:24,420
kind of a God, who is your inner self.

171
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,288
You see, you've got a lower self, which you can call your ego.

172
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:31,840
That's that little scoundrel fellow that's always out

173
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,020
for me. But behind the ego there is the Atman,

174
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,352
the inner self, the inward light, as Quakers would call

175
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:44,800
it, the real self, the spirit, which is substantially

176
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,208
identical with God. So you've

177
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:51,930
got to meditate in such a way that you identify with your

178
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,170
higher self. How do you do that? Well, you start by watching all

179
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,390
your thoughts very carefully.

180
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,830
Watching your feelings, watching your emotions,

181
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:09,066
so that you begin to build up a sense of separation between

182
00:14:09,138 --> 00:14:11,870
the watcher and what is watched,

183
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,986
so that you are, as it were, no longer carried away by your own stream

184
00:14:19,018 --> 00:14:22,976
of consciousness. You remain the witness, impassively,

185
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:27,312
impartially suspending judgment and

186
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:28,780
watching it all go on.

187
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,144
Who is this self behind the self? The watching

188
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:38,540
self? Can you watch that one?

189
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,300
It's interesting if you do,

190
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,490
because you find out, of course, that this is just as

191
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,170
the problem of grace is

192
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:55,122
nothing more than a transposition of the first problem. How am

193
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:58,510
I to be unselfish? By my own power.

194
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,870
It becomes, how am I to get grace? By my own power?

195
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,594
So in the same way we find that the watching self,

196
00:15:06,642 --> 00:15:10,722
or the observing self behind all our thoughts and feelings, is itself

197
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:13,900
a thought. If I desire not

198
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,960
to desire, is that not already desire?

199
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,040
How can I desire not to desire?

200
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,460
How can I surrender myself when

201
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,428
myself is precisely an urge

202
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:34,300
to hold on, to cling, to cling to

203
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,076
life, to continue to survive? I can see

204
00:15:38,148 --> 00:15:41,430
rationally that by clinging to myself I may

205
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,810
strangle myself.

206
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,010
How can I outwit me?

207
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,530
How can I one up me?

208
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:59,210
You see, the reason you want to be better is the reason why you aren't.

209
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:06,880
Shall I put it like we

210
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,100
aren't better because we want to be.

211
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,820
If you say you want to improve,

212
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,024
then you ought to know what's good for you, but obviously

213
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:22,580
you don't, because if you did, you would be improved.

214
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:30,870
So we don't know Sa

215
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,240
all stars are free.

216
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,320
We are aboard the ferry boat Vallejo,

217
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,680
which is tied up at the north end of Sausalito, close to San.

218
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,872
And this is where I live. And you may think this

219
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:35,248
place is rather weird, but that's because I've

220
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:39,072
always loved weird things. I remember when I was a

221
00:17:39,096 --> 00:17:42,672
little boy, people used to say to me, alan, you're so weird.

222
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:46,112
Why can't you be like other people? Well,

223
00:17:46,136 --> 00:17:49,792
I thought that was just plain dull, like having the same thing for

224
00:17:49,816 --> 00:17:53,872
dinner every day. And as is well said, variety is

225
00:17:53,896 --> 00:17:55,100
the spice of life.

226
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,712
And when I think over the weirdest of all things I

227
00:18:09,736 --> 00:18:11,660
can think of, you know what it is?

228
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,208
Nothing. Tagung. The great

229
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:19,540
emptiness. The whole

230
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,818
idea of nothing is

231
00:18:23,874 --> 00:18:26,910
something that has bugged people for centuries,

232
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,370
especially in the west, because we have a

233
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,258
saying in Latin, ex nihilo, nihil fit, which means

234
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,950
that out of nothing comes nothing.

235
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,390
You can't, in other words, get something out of nothing.

236
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:46,590
And it's occurred to me that this is a fallacy

237
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,550
of tremendous proportions that lies at the root

238
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,798
of all our common sense. Not only in the west,

239
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:57,142
but in many parts of the east as well. And it comes up as

240
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,774
a kind of terror of nothing. A put down on nothing,

241
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:03,910
on everything to do with nothing. Everything associated with nothing.

242
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,518
Such as sleep, passivity,

243
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:07,410
rest.

244
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,860
What has struck me is that nothing,

245
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,020
the negative, the empty.

246
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,100
Is exceedingly powerful.

247
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,740
Nothing is more fertile than emptiness.

248
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,032
I would say, not ex nihilo nihil fit. Out of

249
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:37,296
nothing comes nothing. But I would say you can't have something without

250
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:41,002
nothing. So how do we

251
00:19:41,106 --> 00:19:44,346
basically begin to think about the difference between

252
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:48,202
something and nothing? I can say there is a cigar in

253
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:51,370
my right hand. And there is no cigar in my left hand.

254
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,034
And so we get the idea of is here and isn't.

255
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:58,330
Or empty here. But behind that,

256
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,746
of course. Lies the far more obvious contrast of

257
00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:04,630
solid and space.

258
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,040
Now, we tend to think of space as nothing.

259
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,680
When we talk about the conquest of space.

260
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,596
There's a little element. Notice of hostility in that phrase.

261
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:22,440
But actually, we're talking about the conquest of distance,

262
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,180
space as such. That is to say, whatever it is that lies

263
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,040
between the Earth and the Moon. And the Earth and the Sun.

264
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,890
Is considered to be just nothing at all.

265
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,150
But to suggest how very powerful and important this

266
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,590
nothing at all is. Let me point out to you.

267
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,510
That if you didn't have space. You couldn't have anything

268
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,690
solid to begin with.

269
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:55,782
Without space outside the solid. You wouldn't know where the solid's edges

270
00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:59,300
were. For example, you can see me on the camera.

271
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,520
Because you see a background here and

272
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,784
all around me. And that background shows up my outline.

273
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:10,992
It's, for example, difficult to see a hand unless

274
00:21:11,056 --> 00:21:14,304
there is a contrasting background. Were there no background

275
00:21:14,352 --> 00:21:17,380
of the hand, the hand itself would vanish.

276
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,540
Nothing is more fertile than emptiness.

277
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,168
But you always have to have a background to see a figure.

278
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:30,944
You just can't do without it. To have the whole

279
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:34,240
idea of there being only space and nothing else at

280
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,020
all. Is not only inconceivable. But perfectly meaningless.

281
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,384
Because we always know what we mean by contrasts.

282
00:21:42,512 --> 00:21:46,016
We know what we mean by white in comparison with

283
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:49,308
black. They must come into being together.

284
00:21:49,464 --> 00:21:53,108
Because of the inseparability of these opposites. They always go

285
00:21:53,164 --> 00:21:56,964
together. This, as it were, hints at some kind of unity

286
00:21:57,012 --> 00:22:00,260
which underlies them. You don't have first something,

287
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,868
then nothing. Or first nothing, and then something. This unity

288
00:22:04,964 --> 00:22:07,908
is called Tao. Space and form,

289
00:22:07,964 --> 00:22:11,732
in that sense go together. As the fundamental things we're dealing with in

290
00:22:11,756 --> 00:22:16,514
this universe. That which is void precisely

291
00:22:16,562 --> 00:22:20,178
form. And that which is form is precisely

292
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:21,110
void.

293
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,242
Now it's amazing what doesn't exist in the

294
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:29,230
real world.

295
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,990
In the real world, there aren't any things,

296
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,810
nor are there any events. That doesn't mean to

297
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,772
say that the real world is a perfectly featureless

298
00:22:43,836 --> 00:22:47,132
blank. It means that

299
00:22:47,156 --> 00:22:50,076
it is a marvelous system of wiggles.

300
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:53,868
You cannot have the ups without

301
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:57,660
the downs. Now, the same thing is true of all

302
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,660
life together. We shouldn't really contrast

303
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,160
existence with non existence. The unconscious

304
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:11,430
is, so to say, the part of experience which is doing

305
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,766
consciousness. Just as the trough manifests

306
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:19,702
the wave, the space manifests

307
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:23,334
the solid, the background manifests

308
00:23:23,382 --> 00:23:26,970
the figure. So it's interconnected.

309
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,222
And so the many, many patterns of interconnections.

310
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:34,356
Lock it all together into a unity. Which is, however,

311
00:23:34,518 --> 00:23:37,880
much too complicated for us to think about. Except in very,

312
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,740
very simple, crude ways.

313
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,700
But I am part of this.

314
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,580
And so all that side of life which you call unconscious,

315
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,432
unknown, impenetrable. Is unconscious

316
00:23:57,496 --> 00:24:01,234
and is unknown. And is impenetrable because it's

317
00:24:01,282 --> 00:24:02,350
really you.

318
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,914
Nothing is what brings something

319
00:24:23,002 --> 00:24:27,266
into focus. Nothing. And this nothingness,

320
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:29,030
symbolized by the Krishna.

321
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,810
Is your own eyeball, your own consciousness.

322
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:39,222
And the clear space in

323
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:41,970
which all the stars have breathing to be seen.

324
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,360
Every living body is something like the flame of a candle.

325
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,932
This living thing that you're feeling like

326
00:25:15,956 --> 00:25:18,280
the gyroscope top. It's your own life.

327
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,260
Because you can see, very simply, that you would not

328
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,564
understand the experience that you call voluntary

329
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:31,652
action and decision. Being in control and

330
00:25:31,676 --> 00:25:35,652
being yourself. Unless, in opposition to

331
00:25:35,676 --> 00:25:39,412
that, there was something else you

332
00:25:39,436 --> 00:25:43,220
couldn't realize self and control and will.

333
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,750
Unless there was something other out

334
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,570
of control. And instead of will, won't.

335
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,782
It's the two together only. That produces the

336
00:25:54,806 --> 00:25:59,838
sensation. That you call having a personal identity only.

337
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:03,150
There is a funny thing about human consciousness. Which has been worked out

338
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,822
very carefully in gestalt psychology. Which is that our

339
00:26:07,846 --> 00:26:11,810
attention is captured by the figure rather than the background.

340
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,264
By the relatively enclosed area rather than the diffuse

341
00:26:16,312 --> 00:26:19,992
area. And by something moving rather than what is

342
00:26:20,016 --> 00:26:24,040
relatively still. And to all those phenomena

343
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,512
that in this way attract our attention. We attribute a

344
00:26:27,536 --> 00:26:30,712
higher degree of reality than the ones we

345
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:34,776
don't notice. That's only because,

346
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:38,584
for the moment, those are more important to us. Consciousness,

347
00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:43,832
you see, is a radar that

348
00:26:43,856 --> 00:26:46,540
is scanning the environment to look out for trouble.

349
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,220
Just in the same way as a ship's radar is looking for rocks

350
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,008
or other ships. And the radar, therefore,

351
00:26:56,104 --> 00:26:59,480
does not notice the vast areas of

352
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,540
space. Where there are no rocks, no other ships.

353
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,562
So in the same way, our eyes, or rather

354
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:13,514
the selective Consciousness behind the eyes only pays attention

355
00:27:13,562 --> 00:27:17,450
to what we think is important. And so in this way,

356
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,110
we have this rather myopic way of looking at things.

357
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,310
And we screen out from attention

358
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:29,610
anything that is

359
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:33,626
not immediately important. To a scanning system

360
00:27:33,698 --> 00:27:35,470
based on sensing danger.

361
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,932
But quite obviously, you, as a complete individual.

362
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:44,440
Are much more than the scanning system.

363
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:50,760
You are in relationships with the external world.

364
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,720
That, on the whole, are incredibly harmonious.

365
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,580
Going back to this illustration of every living body. Is something

366
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,200
like the flame of a candle.

367
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,686
The energies of life in the form of temperature,

368
00:28:08,878 --> 00:28:12,350
light, air and food and so on.

369
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,982
Are streaming through you all at this moment. In the most magnificently

370
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:20,030
harmonious way. And you're,

371
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,010
all of you, far more beautiful than any candle flame.

372
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,342
Just sitting in these chairs, just going,

373
00:28:27,446 --> 00:28:28,090
no.

374
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,088
Only we are so used to it. We say about that,

375
00:28:34,144 --> 00:28:37,180
so what? Show me something interesting.

376
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,624
Show me something new. Because it's a

377
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:45,944
characteristic of consciousness. That it ignores stimuli

378
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:47,100
that are constant.

379
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:02,626
When anything is constant. It says, okay, that's safe. It's in the bag.

380
00:29:02,738 --> 00:29:04,630
Needn't pay attention to that anymore.

381
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,210
And therefore, we eliminate systematically from our

382
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,002
awareness. All the gorgeous things that are going on all

383
00:29:14,026 --> 00:29:17,682
the time. And instead only become focused on the

384
00:29:17,706 --> 00:29:20,350
things. The troublesome things that might happen to upset it.

385
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,770
Which is all right. But we make too much of it

386
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,510
and become. We make so much of it that

387
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,590
we identify our very selves. I ego with

388
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:36,250
the radar, with the troubleshooter.

389
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:40,610
And that's only a tiny fragment of one's total being.

390
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,610
So that if you do become aware.

391
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,894
That you are not simply that scanning

392
00:29:47,942 --> 00:29:52,010
mechanism. But you are your complete organism. Then very

393
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:55,786
swiftly in turn, as a consequence of that. You become

394
00:29:55,858 --> 00:29:59,418
aware that your organism is

395
00:29:59,474 --> 00:30:03,002
not the way you think about it. When you look at it from

396
00:30:03,026 --> 00:30:06,346
the standpoint of conscious attention. From the standpoint of the ego.

397
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:10,070
From the standpoint of the ego. Your organism is

398
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,802
your kind of vehicle. Your automobile in which you go

399
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:14,390
around.

400
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,760
But from a physical point of view.

401
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,004
Your organism is again, like the candle

402
00:30:24,052 --> 00:30:28,084
flame or the whirlpool. It is something which is a continuous

403
00:30:28,132 --> 00:30:31,640
patterning or activity of the whole cosmos.

404
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,120
The key idea here is pattern.

405
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:44,890
Let's suppose. I'm going to borrow a metaphor from Buckminster Fuller.

406
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,210
Suppose we have a rope.

407
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:52,886
And one section of this rope is made of manila hemp.

408
00:30:53,078 --> 00:30:56,742
The next section is cotton. The next section is silk.

409
00:30:56,886 --> 00:30:59,490
The next section is nylon, and so on.

410
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,410
Now, we tie a knot in this rope.

411
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:07,206
Just an ordinary one over knot. You find by putting

412
00:31:07,238 --> 00:31:10,010
your finger in the knot. You can move it all the way down. The rope.

413
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:15,262
Now, as this knot travels, it's first of all made

414
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:18,446
of manila hemp. It's then made of cotton. It's then made of silk.

415
00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:22,686
It's then made of nylon and so on. But the knot keeps

416
00:31:22,718 --> 00:31:26,334
going on. That's the integrity

417
00:31:26,382 --> 00:31:29,450
of pattern, the continuing pattern, which is what you are.

418
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:33,646
Because you might, you know, be for several years. You might be a vegetarian,

419
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:37,742
and you might be a meat eater and so on. And, you know, your constitution

420
00:31:37,806 --> 00:31:41,402
changes all the time. But people, your friends, still recognize you because

421
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:45,722
you're still putting on the same show. It's the same pattern that

422
00:31:45,746 --> 00:31:47,950
is the recognizable individual.

423
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,354
But we are trained in our language. The very structure

424
00:31:53,402 --> 00:31:58,682
of the language we talk deceives us into misunderstanding

425
00:31:58,746 --> 00:32:02,510
this. Because when we see a pattern,

426
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,720
we ask, what's it made of?

427
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,412
Like, you see a table, is it made of wood, or is it made of

428
00:32:12,436 --> 00:32:16,348
aluminum? But then when you inquire into

429
00:32:16,404 --> 00:32:20,268
what is wood and how does wood differ from aluminum?

430
00:32:20,444 --> 00:32:23,852
The only thing a scientist can tell you is the different patterns, that is

431
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:27,320
to say, the different molecular structure of the two things.

432
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,812
And a molecular structure is not a description of

433
00:32:30,836 --> 00:32:35,480
what something is made of. It is a description of what dance it is performing,

434
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,876
what motions, what kind of a symphony. This is because

435
00:32:39,948 --> 00:32:43,160
basically all phenomena of life are musical.

436
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,332
And gold differs from lead in exactly the

437
00:32:47,356 --> 00:32:50,280
same way that a waltz differs from a mazurka.

438
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,796
It's a different dance, and there isn't

439
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:59,316
anything that's dancing. That is a deception

440
00:32:59,348 --> 00:33:03,002
we get into because we have two parts of speech in our grammar. We have

441
00:33:03,026 --> 00:33:06,442
nouns and verbs. And verbs are

442
00:33:06,466 --> 00:33:09,230
supposed to describe the activities of nouns.

443
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:14,714
And this is simply a convention of speech. You could have a language

444
00:33:14,762 --> 00:33:18,074
with only verbs in it. You don't need any nouns. Or you could also have

445
00:33:18,082 --> 00:33:20,430
a language with nouns only and no verbs.

446
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:25,658
And it would perfectly adequately describe what's

447
00:33:25,674 --> 00:33:26,790
going on in the world.

448
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,580
So if you were used to speaking with a language that had one

449
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:36,720
part of speech, you could say just as much as we can with two

450
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,692
and be a lot clearer. Only at first it would

451
00:33:40,716 --> 00:33:44,020
sound awkward, but you'd soon get used to it. And then when you got

452
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:48,660
used to it, it would be a matter of common sense that the patterning

453
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,308
of the world is not some kind of stuff that's patterning.

454
00:33:52,404 --> 00:33:55,960
You don't have to seek for a substance underlying the whole thing. It's just patterning.

455
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,460
And we're all that.

456
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,324
Now. We come here right at the start to an extremely important

457
00:34:57,412 --> 00:35:03,292
principle, which is the

458
00:35:03,316 --> 00:35:07,040
different points of view you get when you Change your level of magnification.

459
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,052
That is to say, you can look at something with a microscope and see it

460
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:13,974
a certain way. You can look at it with the naked eye and see it

461
00:35:13,982 --> 00:35:16,694
in a certain way. You look at it with a telescope, and you see it

462
00:35:16,702 --> 00:35:20,614
in another way. Now, which level of magnification

463
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:24,166
is the correct one? Well, obviously they're

464
00:35:24,198 --> 00:35:27,410
all correct. They're just different points of view.

465
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:31,750
You can, for example, look at a newspaper photograph

466
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:35,766
under a magnifying glass. And where with the naked

467
00:35:35,798 --> 00:35:39,644
eye, you will see a human face with a magnifying glass, you will see a

468
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:42,960
profusion of dots rather meaninglessly scattered.

469
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,044
But as you stand away from that connection of dots.

470
00:35:48,172 --> 00:35:51,436
Which all seem to be separate and apart from each other,

471
00:35:51,588 --> 00:35:54,240
they suddenly arrange themselves into a pattern.

472
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,700
And you see that these individual dots add

473
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,240
up to some kind of sense.

474
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:07,572
Now, you'll see at once from this illustration that maybe

475
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:10,852
you, when you

476
00:36:10,956 --> 00:36:14,000
take a myopic view of yourself, as most of us do,

477
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,564
but you may add up to some kind of sense that is

478
00:36:20,572 --> 00:36:22,920
not apparent to you in your ordinary consciousness.

479
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,068
Well, it is claimed, you see, that some human beings have broken through

480
00:36:28,124 --> 00:36:31,860
to that vision. That they slipped

481
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:36,270
somehow or other into states of consciousness

482
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:42,922
where they see the apparent disintegration

483
00:36:42,986 --> 00:36:46,058
and disorganization of

484
00:36:46,114 --> 00:36:50,218
everyday life as the

485
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:55,370
functioning of a totality which

486
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:59,230
at its level is completely harmonious.

487
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,112
And you could say, aha, at last I see. I got the

488
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:10,340
point. I've seen how all this makes sense.

489
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,740
That's what it is. That's what we notice.

490
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,830
But what this insight depended upon was

491
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:39,510
your overcoming the

492
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:43,990
illusion that space separates

493
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:44,690
things.

494
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:53,284
We tend to see the universe itself really consisting

495
00:37:53,332 --> 00:37:55,320
in all the stars and galaxies.

496
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:02,516
But the space in which all this happens is sort of written

497
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:04,400
off as something that isn't really there.

498
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:12,740
But what one has to realize is that the space is

499
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,280
an essential function of the things in the space.

500
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:22,530
After all, you can't have separate stars

501
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,130
unless there is a space around.

502
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:30,890
Eliminate the space, and you will see you couldn't have this phenomenon at all.

503
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,166
And vice versa, you couldn't

504
00:38:35,198 --> 00:38:38,734
have the space. They wouldn't be there in any sense whatsoever

505
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:42,494
if there weren't the bodies in it. So the bodies in

506
00:38:42,502 --> 00:38:45,866
the space and the space are two aspects of a single

507
00:38:45,898 --> 00:38:49,066
continuum. They're related together in exactly

508
00:38:49,098 --> 00:38:50,950
the same way as a back and a front.

509
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,830
And you just don't get one without the other.

510
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:03,150
So the moment you see that intervals, that space is connective,

511
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:09,270
you can understand at once how

512
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:15,270
you are not just

513
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:22,890
to be exclusively defined as

514
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:26,314
A flash of consciousness that occurs between two eternal

515
00:39:26,362 --> 00:39:27,310
darknesses.

516
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:33,578
And what you call yourself as a living organism.

517
00:39:33,674 --> 00:39:36,870
Say I am my whole body at the very least.

518
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:41,954
Now, what is that body? That body is recognizable.

519
00:39:42,082 --> 00:39:45,906
And I recognize my friends when I meet them again. Good luck.

520
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:49,682
And you recognize me. Although the last time any

521
00:39:49,706 --> 00:39:53,666
of you saw me, I was absolutely something entirely

522
00:39:53,698 --> 00:39:56,738
different from what I am now. Just as

523
00:39:56,794 --> 00:40:00,098
the flame of a candle is never a constant,

524
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:03,270
the flame of a candle is a stream of hot gas.

525
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:07,640
Only you say the flame of the candle as if it were a constant.

526
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,640
Well, it is a recognizably constant pattern.

527
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,620
The spear shaped outline of the flame and its coloration is

528
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,188
a constant pattern. But in exactly the same way we

529
00:40:19,244 --> 00:40:22,900
are all constant patterns. And that's all we are. The only

530
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:26,052
thing constant about us at all is the doing rather than the

531
00:40:26,076 --> 00:40:29,890
being. It's the way we behave, the. The way we dance.

532
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:33,730
Only there's no we that dances. There's just the dancing.

533
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:38,734
Just as the flame is the streaming of hot gas.

534
00:40:38,862 --> 00:40:42,014
Just as a whirlpool in a river is a whirling of streaming

535
00:40:42,062 --> 00:40:45,690
water. There is no

536
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,770
thing that whirlpools.

537
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:54,760
There is the whirlpool. And in the same way, each one of us is

538
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,952
a very, very delightfully complex undulation of

539
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:00,700
the energy of the whole universe.

540
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,860
Only by our process of miseducation,

541
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,390
we've been deprived of the knowledge of that

542
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:28,130
fact. Not as if there was someone to blame for this.

543
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,890
Because it's always with our own tacit consent.

544
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:38,182
Because life is basically a game of

545
00:41:38,206 --> 00:41:39,290
hide and seek.

546
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,450
Because life is pulsation.

547
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,860
On and off. Here it is, and now it isn't.

548
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,420
All life, you see, is this flickering in and out.

549
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,540
And by being this pulsation,

550
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,540
we know it's there.

551
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,152
See, you don't know what you mean

552
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:11,500
by on unless you know what you mean by off.

553
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:15,730
In the darkness that comes before your birth,

554
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:20,206
there was no you. And in the eternal

555
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:23,614
darkness that follows your death, there is likewise

556
00:42:23,662 --> 00:42:24,490
no you.

557
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:37,990
Sa.

558
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,180
What do I desire?

559
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,100
Well, when we answer that question in a naive way,

560
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,500
we figure out that we want a desire.

561
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,740
What we want is to control everything.

562
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,232
To create girls that don't grow old,

563
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:31,240
apples that don't rotate, clothes that never wear out,

564
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,948
conveyances that get from one place to another instantly. So we don't

565
00:43:35,964 --> 00:43:39,372
have to wait power available to do anything that you

566
00:43:39,396 --> 00:43:42,040
could conceive and do it just instantly like that.

567
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,680
To get this funny technological omnipotence.

568
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,560
But if you take time out to think about that

569
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,748
and really go into it with your full strength of imagination

570
00:43:56,924 --> 00:43:59,640
and find out whether that's where you want to be.

571
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,640
You will soon see that's not what you want.

572
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,980
Because the moment you have a situation where

573
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:17,676
you are really in control of things, that is to say, in which the future

574
00:44:17,748 --> 00:44:20,880
is almost completely predictable,

575
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:25,974
you will see, as I said last night, that a completely predictable

576
00:44:26,022 --> 00:44:29,010
future is already the past. You've had it.

577
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,490
That's not what you wanted. You want a surprise.

578
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,486
You don't know what that's going to be because obviously it wouldn't be a surprise

579
00:44:38,518 --> 00:44:42,410
if you did. You want a pleasant surprise,

580
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,410
but like you say, what sort of a surprise would be pleasant?

581
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,792
And you can't really answer that because you know,

582
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:57,296
if there are to be such things as pleasant surprises, there must also be unpleasant

583
00:44:57,328 --> 00:44:59,380
surprises. There must be rude shots.

584
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,952
So you're like somebody taking one

585
00:45:03,976 --> 00:45:07,232
of those wishing well boxes, you know, tubs, you know, where you

586
00:45:07,256 --> 00:45:10,928
fish in and you bring out a package and you don't know whether you've

587
00:45:10,944 --> 00:45:13,640
got a dead rat in it or a new camera.

588
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,716
And that's the way that's. That seems to be the thing that really excites

589
00:45:21,748 --> 00:45:22,320
people.

590
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:29,732
But quite certainly there comes out of this inquiry a

591
00:45:29,756 --> 00:45:33,716
feeling of real disillusionment

592
00:45:33,748 --> 00:45:35,360
with the ideal of power.

593
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,440
To be in power, to be in control is

594
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,020
not something that any sensible person wants.

595
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,500
Imagine the situation of big brother,

596
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,060
Mr. J. Edgar Hoover,

597
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,140
Heinrich Himmler,

598
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,192
to be glued day and night to

599
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:05,320
a highly defended office with

600
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,510
telephone, television screens,

601
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:13,390
watching, peeking, spying on everyone and anything,

602
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:17,670
getting all this information together. Why you could never leave the office.

603
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:22,442
I mean, the people character, I suppose, like say, Edgar Hoover goes home in the

604
00:46:22,466 --> 00:46:26,218
evening and. But when he's back

605
00:46:26,274 --> 00:46:29,226
home, you know, there are guards sitting outside the door.

606
00:46:29,338 --> 00:46:32,240
There's that hotline telephone going to some. Something.

607
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,612
He's always having to be in control and

608
00:46:36,636 --> 00:46:40,452
he can't take any time off. He can't go for a

609
00:46:40,476 --> 00:46:43,924
walk in the park with a friend or go innocently to

610
00:46:43,932 --> 00:46:47,556
the movies or sit down and just

611
00:46:47,628 --> 00:46:51,200
relax and have an undistracted party in the baths at Big Sur

612
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:57,400
here. What a pauper. This guy is completely deprived

613
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:00,630
because he wants to be in control, because he wants power.

614
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:05,706
People are frustrated in love. Be if you're

615
00:47:05,738 --> 00:47:08,954
jilted. There's a natural tendency in a human being to seek

616
00:47:09,002 --> 00:47:13,050
power as a substitute, and that's a very

617
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:16,362
negative thing. It's like having a bad temper to

618
00:47:16,386 --> 00:47:19,562
seek power after you're frustrated in love. You should try and get back on the

619
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:23,596
love beam because nobody Wants

620
00:47:23,698 --> 00:47:26,920
power. Now, you may

621
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,264
say that shirking responsibility, that if

622
00:47:30,272 --> 00:47:34,376
you were a really responsible person, you would go out for power and

623
00:47:34,448 --> 00:47:38,712
try to use power to the best possible advantage for

624
00:47:38,736 --> 00:47:41,672
the benefit of all. All right,

625
00:47:41,696 --> 00:47:43,380
what would be the benefit of all?

626
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,760
Ask them, what do you want me to do with this

627
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,120
power? I'm dictator. What would you like me to do?

628
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,640
Well, nobody knows because they haven't thought it through. They think

629
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,464
of all sorts of short range things and they are largely conflicting

630
00:47:59,512 --> 00:48:03,368
and confusing because they're not well thought out. But again,

631
00:48:03,424 --> 00:48:06,380
when it finally comes down to it, nobody wants to be God.

632
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,240
Now then, when Oriental philosophy and

633
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,640
religion was first introduced the Western world,

634
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,508
it was introduced under the auspices of people who were fascinated

635
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:22,400
with power.

636
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:29,732
It was introduced in the latter part of the 19th century when we

637
00:48:29,756 --> 00:48:33,060
had heard all about evolution and how the human race was going on

638
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,804
to ever greater heights. And we would eventually develop Superman

639
00:48:36,852 --> 00:48:42,090
according to Nietzsche or D.B. shaw and

640
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:47,006
H.G. wells. Remember all that early fantasy

641
00:48:47,198 --> 00:48:50,574
of where evolution would lead through the development

642
00:48:50,662 --> 00:48:54,174
of technology. And so at this time,

643
00:48:54,342 --> 00:48:58,382
people like HP Blavatsky were talking about the

644
00:48:58,406 --> 00:49:02,846
mysterious wisdom of the east, and they phrased

645
00:49:02,878 --> 00:49:06,450
it, they commended it to us in a technological spirit,

646
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,632
that there was psychic technology, that there

647
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,704
was something that you could go way beyond anything that could be done through the

648
00:49:13,712 --> 00:49:14,940
physical sciences.

649
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,848
You could cause your physical body to

650
00:49:19,904 --> 00:49:23,060
disintegrate to another

651
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:28,380
level of vibration and then transmit it and reassemble it somewhere else.

652
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,222
You could live as long as you like because you control the fundamental processes.

653
00:49:34,336 --> 00:49:37,922
You could determine if you decided to die where you would be reborn.

654
00:49:37,986 --> 00:49:41,746
Exactly. You would be a complete master

655
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:45,314
of life. And so there are still innumerable books

656
00:49:45,362 --> 00:49:49,266
being sold which present oriental philosophy and religion

657
00:49:49,298 --> 00:49:53,394
in this light. That charlatan Lobsang

658
00:49:53,442 --> 00:49:57,630
Ramper, who writes about

659
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:02,598
Tibetan mastery, people read that

660
00:50:02,654 --> 00:50:06,182
because they. They think that there may be a way

661
00:50:06,206 --> 00:50:07,490
of beating the game.

662
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:15,210
So therefore, the wise men of Asia were represented

663
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:19,530
through this kind of propaganda

664
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:24,758
as masters of life. As, for example, people whose

665
00:50:24,774 --> 00:50:28,000
emotions didn't bother them, who could put

666
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,700
up with any amount of pain by simply turning off their feelings,

667
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,420
who could foretell the future,

668
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,540
who could read your thoughts,

669
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,656
and who were above all kinds of ordinary human

670
00:50:46,728 --> 00:50:47,620
frailty.

671
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:55,162
Well, when I first met Buddhist

672
00:50:55,226 --> 00:50:57,690
priests, Zen masters,

673
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:01,470
swamis, all these wise men from the east,

674
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:05,834
one of the first things that impressed itself upon me was that they were perfectly

675
00:51:05,882 --> 00:51:07,550
ordinary human beings.

676
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:13,866
They had bad tempers, they were fussy

677
00:51:13,898 --> 00:51:17,636
about certain things. They just acted

678
00:51:17,668 --> 00:51:20,612
as I would expect human beings to act. And so at first I was very

679
00:51:20,636 --> 00:51:23,380
disappointed. I thought they had feet of clay,

680
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,560
that they didn't come up to these promises of psycho technology.

681
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:33,060
But after a while I got to realize why. Not that they had already thought

682
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:37,076
all that through. They had thought through what

683
00:51:37,148 --> 00:51:40,804
might be done if one had all these powers. And it decided

684
00:51:40,852 --> 00:51:45,006
that wasn't what they wanted. The powers

685
00:51:45,038 --> 00:51:48,590
of this kind in Sanskrit are called siddhi S I

686
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:49,930
D D H I.

687
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:55,390
But there is hardly one decent scripture or text on

688
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:58,846
yoga that does not say again and again, if you get siddhi,

689
00:51:58,878 --> 00:52:02,110
ignore them, go on

690
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:05,678
to something else. These are only the foothills. These are

691
00:52:05,734 --> 00:52:08,872
furthermore, not only foothills, but. But they are seductive.

692
00:52:08,936 --> 00:52:12,616
Blind alleys won't

693
00:52:12,648 --> 00:52:14,100
take you anywhere at all.

694
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,872
Now, I think that this is the greatest possible

695
00:52:21,056 --> 00:52:24,536
lesson for the Western world to learn, because we are

696
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:28,056
so hung up on the idea of power, of control,

697
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:31,560
of being able to make everything go the right way. And if

698
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,882
we've never thought it through, when you get control of it, what are you going

699
00:52:34,906 --> 00:52:35,790
to do with it?

700
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:48,530
The self is

701
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:50,110
the basis of all being.

702
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:56,430
And being is not something into which we come,

703
00:52:57,850 --> 00:52:59,670
but out of which we proceed.

704
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,600
In popular language, we say, I came into this world as

705
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,100
if you came from somewhere else altogether, from outside.

706
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,752
But you don't. You come out of this world just

707
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:18,460
in the same way as the leaves come from the tree.

708
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,740
And so in that way you are an expression of it.

709
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:31,830
And the self meaning itself,

710
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:35,590
self meaning,

711
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:40,070
identity, self meaning,

712
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:48,450
basis, ground is

713
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,350
what everybody fundamentally is.

714
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,180
Then I went on to discuss the world as

715
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:58,412
the self, in the sense of the cosmos as

716
00:53:58,436 --> 00:54:02,120
the self. The great cycles of time,

717
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:06,000
the world is manifested and then again withdrawn.

718
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:15,852
And now I want to go on to discuss the

719
00:54:15,876 --> 00:54:18,110
human world as the self.

720
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:24,170
Well, now there

721
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:27,882
have in the known history of mankind been

722
00:54:27,906 --> 00:54:31,930
about three types of

723
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:35,470
culture. We'll call them hunting cultures,

724
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,910
agrarian cultures,

725
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:42,510
and industrial cultures.

726
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,960
The hunting culture seems to have been the earliest.

727
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:53,324
And agrarian

728
00:54:53,372 --> 00:54:57,020
cultures arose when hunters learned to

729
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:01,340
farm and therefore had to settle

730
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,244
in certain places. And it

731
00:55:05,252 --> 00:55:06,960
was then that men built cities.

732
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:13,382
And when we pass from the

733
00:55:13,406 --> 00:55:17,190
hunting to the agrarian culture, we notice two

734
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:22,662
very important changes occur in

735
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:28,886
the hunting culture. Every man is

736
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,930
expert in the whole culture.

737
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,552
That's because he spends a good deal of time alone in

738
00:55:37,576 --> 00:55:40,820
the forests or on the hills.

739
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,380
And so he has to know how to make clothes,

740
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,660
how to cook, how to build,

741
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,260
how to fight,

742
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,900
ride, and all those things.

743
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:04,314
But as soon as people become settled

744
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:08,430
in cities, we get a division of labor,

745
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:14,970
because it's obviously more practical when you're all living together for some

746
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:18,230
People to specialize in some things and some in others.

747
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:26,750
Now then, reasonably enough, the first communities

748
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,760
are stockaded enclosures. They are made

749
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,280
of palings. And so we speak of people being

750
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,020
within the pale and beyond the pale.

751
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,260
So here is a primitive stockaded community.

752
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,392
And as often as not, this community

753
00:56:49,496 --> 00:56:53,962
will settle at a crossroads for

754
00:56:53,986 --> 00:56:57,510
obvious reasons. Where roads cross, that's where people meet.

755
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:01,818
And so it's liable to have four

756
00:57:01,874 --> 00:57:05,258
gates and these crossing main streets.

757
00:57:05,434 --> 00:57:08,570
And that immediately establishes four divisions of the

758
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:13,098
city. In Hindu society, there are four castes

759
00:57:13,274 --> 00:57:16,350
based on the four fundamental divisions of labor.

760
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:21,180
And number one is the caste of priests,

761
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,780
and they're called brahmana. Number two

762
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,620
is the caste of warriors and also rulers,

763
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,740
and they're called kshatriya.

764
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,376
Number three is the caste of merchants and tradesmen,

765
00:57:40,568 --> 00:57:44,600
and they're called vaishya. And number four are

766
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,380
laborers and they are called shudra.

767
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:54,104
So those are the four principal

768
00:57:54,152 --> 00:57:57,540
roles in

769
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,180
the world of settled humanity.

770
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,860
So now then, those are the roles.

771
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,940
Those are, you might say,

772
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:13,344
masks in this game called the social

773
00:58:13,432 --> 00:58:16,220
game. Now then,

774
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,088
when you enter society, you are born into a caste.

775
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:25,200
And this is very understandable in a community where you

776
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,780
don't have a generalized system of education,

777
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,592
you don't go to school, and therefore

778
00:58:34,656 --> 00:58:38,384
you learn what to do in life from your parents

779
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:41,860
and your family. So if

780
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:45,560
you grow up as a carpenter's son,

781
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:50,040
it never occurs to you to do anything else but carpentry.

782
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,760
Why would you?

783
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,720
You might become a better carpenter than your father.

784
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,800
But still that would be the natural thing to do.

785
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:07,902
It's only when one

786
00:59:07,926 --> 00:59:11,646
is exposed to school, people begin

787
00:59:11,678 --> 00:59:14,250
to talk about, well, what do you want to be in life?

788
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:19,890
That people get the idea that they might be anything.

789
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:24,382
You see, what happens is this, then, that an individual

790
00:59:24,446 --> 00:59:29,470
who all his life long has played the social game is

791
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:31,690
then says, well, now I've done that.

792
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:35,160
I've assumed this role. I've become identified.

793
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,560
But now who am I really?

794
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:42,120
In order to find that out, I have to go off by myself.

795
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:48,628
Why? Because you

796
00:59:48,684 --> 00:59:51,956
have a role conception, a mask conception

797
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:55,440
of yourself because other people tell you who you are.

798
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,800
We are constantly in every social interchange,

799
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,320
in the most common remarks, telling other people

800
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:09,320
who they are. Everybody around you

801
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,208
is telling you what you are and who you are by expecting

802
01:00:13,304 --> 01:00:16,744
certain behavior from you, which, if you're a

803
01:00:16,752 --> 01:00:20,296
reasonable and socially inclined person, you perform because that's

804
01:00:20,328 --> 01:00:21,700
what's expected of you.

805
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,818
So you are told who you are. You have

806
01:00:27,954 --> 01:00:31,898
a political and social analog of

807
01:00:31,954 --> 01:00:35,082
the manifestation and withdrawal of

808
01:00:35,106 --> 01:00:39,994
the worlds of the Lord playing

809
01:00:40,082 --> 01:00:43,910
the game, or the self playing the game of being all of us.

810
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:50,330
And then the self realizes

811
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:54,082
in terms of an individual life, that it is the

812
01:00:54,106 --> 01:00:57,538
self. And so you can have this

813
01:00:57,594 --> 01:01:01,202
sensation, you see, of total unity with the

814
01:01:01,226 --> 01:01:05,986
cosmos, of the expansion

815
01:01:06,018 --> 01:01:08,630
to infinity or contraction to infinity,

816
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:13,346
without forgetting society's game rules with regard

817
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:16,834
to you. In other words, it doesn't mean that you forget your address,

818
01:01:16,922 --> 01:01:20,540
telephone number, Social Security security number. You remember all that,

819
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,780
and you can play that game when necessary.

820
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:43,970
But you know it's a game sa.
