1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,288
It's very commonly said that the root of most human

2
00:00:05,344 --> 00:00:08,520
unhappiness is the sense that one's life

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,660
has no meaning.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,352
This is, I suppose, most frequently said in circles

5
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:20,568
interested in psychotherapy, because the feeling

6
00:00:20,584 --> 00:00:24,568
of meaninglessness is often equated with the

7
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:26,380
existence of neurosis.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,648
And so many activities into which one is

9
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:35,312
encouraged to enter philosophies one is encouraged to

10
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:39,632
believe, and religions one is encouraged to join are

11
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:43,380
commended on the basis of the fact that they give life a meaning.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,104
I think it's very fascinating to think out what this

13
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:54,450
idea itself means or what it is

14
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,150
intended. When it's said that life has to have a purpose.

15
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,510
Well, now it's pretty obvious, I think,

16
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,790
that when we talk about life having or not having a meaning,

17
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,190
we're not using quite the ordinary sense of the word meaning

18
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,710
as the attribute of a sign.

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,314
We're not saying, are we, that we expect this natural

20
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:24,460
universe to behave as if it were a collection of words signifying

21
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,800
something other than themselves.

22
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,948
It isn't a point of view which would reduce our

23
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:37,360
lives in the world merely to the status of signs.

24
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,720
All that is mortal or all that is perishable

25
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,960
is but a symbol.

26
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,770
And so a symbol of what?

27
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,262
What do we want to feel? What would satisfy us

28
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:01,850
as being the meaning

29
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,730
behind this world?

30
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,590
It's so often, you know, that we don't follow our

31
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,854
ideas and our desires through. Most of

32
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:16,742
the things that we want very fervently are things

33
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:20,262
that we've only half glimpsed. Our ideals are

34
00:02:20,286 --> 00:02:22,810
very often suggestions, hints,

35
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,090
and we don't know really exactly what we mean when we think about it.

36
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,450
But there is this obscure sense

37
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,342
in which we feel that life ought to

38
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:39,782
have significance and be a symbol in at

39
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:42,984
least that sense, if not just so arid a

40
00:02:42,992 --> 00:02:46,648
symbol as a mere sign. Or it

41
00:02:46,704 --> 00:02:50,620
also may mean that life is meaningful.

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,528
An individual feels that his life amounts to something

43
00:02:55,664 --> 00:02:59,784
when he belongs and fits in with the execution

44
00:02:59,832 --> 00:03:03,100
of some group enterprise.

45
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,340
He feels he belongs in a plan.

46
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,780
And this too seems to give people a sense of great satisfaction.

47
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,358
But we have to pursue that question further too. Why is it

48
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:19,774
that a plan. Why is it that fellowship

49
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:23,250
with other people gives the sense of meaning?

50
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,490
Does it come down, perhaps to another sense of meaning?

51
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,582
That life is felt to be meaningful when one is

52
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:34,130
fully satisfying one's biological urges,

53
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,300
including the sense of hunger,

54
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,340
the sense of love, the sense of

55
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,712
self expression in activity,

56
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:52,144
and so on. But then again, we have to push that inquiry

57
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,272
further. What do our biological

58
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,420
urges really point towards?

59
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,834
Are they just, however things always

60
00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:10,762
projected towards A future is biology and its processes

61
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:14,630
nothing but going on towards going on towards going on.

62
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,298
Or there's a fourth and more theological sense of the meaning

63
00:04:20,314 --> 00:04:23,930
of life. In all

64
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,950
theistic religions, at any rate, the meaning of life is God himself.

65
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,280
In other words, all this world means a person,

66
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,480
it means a heart, it means an intelligence.

67
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,084
And the relationship of love between God and man is the meaning of

68
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:45,716
the world. The sight of God is the glory of God,

69
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:49,640
and so on. But again, here there's something to be further pursued.

70
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,650
What is it that we want in

71
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,982
love with a person, and even a

72
00:05:00,006 --> 00:05:02,850
person in the sense of the Lord God?

73
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,702
What is the content of it? What is it that we are really yearning

74
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:07,370
after?

75
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,530
Well, now, if we go back to the first point,

76
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,070
taking Goethe's words, that all that is transitory is

77
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,680
but a symbol, and that we want to feel that

78
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,712
all things have significance. It does seem to me

79
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:29,820
that there's a sense in which we often use the word significance,

80
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,904
where the word seems to be chosen quite naturally,

81
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:37,500
and yet at the same time, it's not quite the right word.

82
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,392
We say, for example, often of music, but we feel it to

83
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,720
be significant when just at the same time,

84
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,704
we don't mean that it expresses some particular

85
00:05:49,872 --> 00:05:53,880
kind of concretely realizable

86
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,040
emotion. And certainly it's not imitating the noises of

87
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,700
nature.

88
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,632
Program Music, you know, would simply imitate

89
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:08,664
something else, and it deliberately sets out to express sadness

90
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:12,472
or joy or whatever, is not the kind

91
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:17,144
of thing. I mean, so often when one listens to the beautiful

92
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:21,320
arabesque character of the Baroque

93
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,340
composers Bach or Vivaldi,

94
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,680
it is felt to be significant not

95
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,020
because it means something other than itself,

96
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,060
but because it is so satisfying as it is.

97
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,010
And we use then this word significance so

98
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,990
often in those moments when our

99
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,714
impetuous seeking for fulfillment cools

100
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:55,630
down and we give ourselves a little space to watch things

101
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,070
as if they were worth watching, ordinary things.

102
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,778
And in those moments when our inner turmoil has really

103
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:07,554
quietened, we find significance

104
00:07:07,602 --> 00:07:10,510
in things that we wouldn't expect to find significant at all.

105
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,770
I mean, this is, after all, the art of those photographers

106
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,890
who have such genius in turning the camera towards

107
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,650
such things as peeling paint on an old door,

108
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,214
or mud and sand and stones on a

109
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:33,990
dirt road, and showing us there that

110
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,170
if we look at it in a certain way, those things are significant.

111
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,450
But we can't say significant of what. So much as significant of themselves,

112
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,130
or perhaps significance, then, is the quality of a state of mind

113
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,822
in which we notice that we

114
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:56,190
are overlooking the significance of the world by our constant

115
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,170
quest for it later.

116
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,530
All this language is of course quite naturally vague and imprecise

117
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,412
because I think the wrong word is used and

118
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:12,692
yet not entirely the wrong word. Because as I said, it comes so naturally

119
00:08:12,756 --> 00:08:16,180
to us that in those moments

120
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,796
the significance of the world seems

121
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:23,280
to be the world seems to be what is going on now.

122
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,332
And we don't look any further. The scheme of things seems to

123
00:08:29,356 --> 00:08:32,360
justify itself at every moment of its unfoldment.

124
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,950
You see, the reason you want to be better is the reason why you aren't.

125
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,430
We aren't better because we want to be.

126
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,520
Because the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

127
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,780
Because all the do gooders in the world, whether they are doing

128
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,500
good for others or doing it for themselves, are troublemakers on

129
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,180
the basis of Kindly let me help you or you'll drown, said the monkey,

130
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,360
putting the fish safely up a tree.

131
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,908
We white Anglo Saxon Protestants, British, German,

132
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:32,538
American have been

133
00:09:32,594 --> 00:09:36,762
on a rampage for the past hundred or more years to improve

134
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:37,670
the world.

135
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,722
We have given the benefits of our culture, our religion, our technology

136
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:47,470
to everybody, except perhaps the Australian Aborigines.

137
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,202
And we have insisted that they receive the benefits of our culture. Even our

138
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,720
political styles are our democracy. You better be

139
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,180
democratic or we'll shoot you.

140
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,056
And having conferred these blessings all over the place, we wonder

141
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:07,700
why everybody hates us.

142
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,760
See, because sometimes doing good to others and even

143
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,380
doing good to oneself is amazingly destructive

144
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,532
because it's full of conceit. How do you know what's good

145
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:27,000
for other people? How do you know what's good for you?

146
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,280
If you say you want to improve,

147
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,516
then you ought to know what's good for you, but obviously

148
00:10:35,548 --> 00:10:39,120
you don't, because if you did you would be improved.

149
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,908
So we don't know. It's like the problem of geneticists

150
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:48,652
which they face today. I went to a meeting of geneticists not so

151
00:10:48,676 --> 00:10:52,060
long ago where they gathered in a group of philosophers and theologians and said,

152
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,330
now look here, we need help.

153
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,782
We now are on the verge of figuring out how to breed

154
00:10:58,846 --> 00:11:02,730
any kind of human character we would want to have.

155
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,374
We can give you saints, philosophers,

156
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:11,038
scientists, great politicians, anything you want.

157
00:11:11,094 --> 00:11:13,970
Just tell us what kind of human beings ought we to breed?

158
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,242
So I said, how will those of

159
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:24,922
us who are genetically unregenerate make up

160
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:29,018
our minds what genetically generate people

161
00:11:29,074 --> 00:11:29,910
might be?

162
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,402
Because I'm afraid very much that our selection

163
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:39,110
of virtues may not work.

164
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:44,058
It may be like for example, this new

165
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:47,760
kind of high yield grain which is made

166
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:54,692
and which is becoming ecologically destructive when

167
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:58,452
we interfere with the processes of nature and breed Efficient

168
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:02,340
plants and efficient animals. There's always some way in which we have to pay for

169
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,532
it. And I can well see that eugenically produced

170
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:09,160
human beings might be dreadful.

171
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:15,210
We could have a plague of virtuous people.

172
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,702
Do you realize that any animal considered in

173
00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:24,302
itself is virtuous? It does its thing, but in crowds.

174
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:25,330
They're awful.

175
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,278
Like a crowd of ants or locusts on the rampage.

176
00:12:31,454 --> 00:12:34,250
They're all perfectly good animals, but it's just too much.

177
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,786
I could imagine a perfectly pestiferous mass

178
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,550
of a million saints.

179
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,910
So I said to these people, look, there's the only thing you can do.

180
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,306
Just be sure that a vast

181
00:12:50,418 --> 00:12:53,190
variety of human beings is maintained.

182
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,082
Don't please breed us down to a few excellent

183
00:12:58,146 --> 00:13:02,162
types. Excellent for what? We never know how circumstances

184
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:06,320
are going to change and how

185
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,452
our need for different kinds of people

186
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:14,148
changes. At one time, we may need

187
00:13:14,204 --> 00:13:18,212
very individualistic and aggressive people. At another time,

188
00:13:18,316 --> 00:13:21,600
we may need very cooperative, team working people.

189
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,732
At another time, we may need people who are

190
00:13:25,756 --> 00:13:29,236
full of interest in dexterous manipulation of the external

191
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:32,890
world. At another time, we may need people who explore into

192
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,550
their own psychology and are introspective.

193
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:40,170
There is no knowing. But the more varieties and the more

194
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,230
skills we have, obviously, the better.

195
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,590
So you see here again, the problem comes out in genetics.

196
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,810
We do not really know how to interfere with the way

197
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,612
the world is. The way the

198
00:13:56,636 --> 00:14:00,580
world actually is is an enormously

199
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,640
complex, interrelated organism.

200
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,420
The same problem arises in medicine because the body is

201
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,160
a very complexly interrelated organism.

202
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,348
And if you look at the body in a superficial way, you may see there's

203
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:19,720
something wrong with it. Here's chickenpox.

204
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,626
And those spots that itch that come all out, all over the place.

205
00:14:23,778 --> 00:14:27,350
Well, you might say, well, spots are there. Cut them off.

206
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,698
So you kill the bug. Well, then you find you've

207
00:14:32,714 --> 00:14:35,850
got real problems because

208
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,610
you had to introduce some bugs to kill the bug. It's like bringing rabbits into

209
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,130
Australia, and that starts going

210
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,442
all over the place and getting out of hand. Well, then you think,

211
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:49,338
well, now, wait a minute. It wasn't the bugs in the blood. There are bugs

212
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:53,100
all over the place. What was wrong with this person that his

213
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,572
blood system suddenly became vulnerable to

214
00:14:56,596 --> 00:15:00,012
those particular bugs? His resistance wasn't up. Therefore, what you

215
00:15:00,036 --> 00:15:03,280
should have given him was not an antibiotic, but vitamins.

216
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,400
Okay, so we're going to build up his resistance. But resistance to what?

217
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,108
You may build up resistance to this and this and this class of bugs.

218
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:17,530
But then there's another one that loves that situation, comes right in.

219
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:23,890
See, we Always look at the human being medically

220
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,830
in bits and pieces. Because we have heart specialists,

221
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,910
lung specialists, bone specialists, nerve specialists and

222
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,270
so on. And they each see the human being from their

223
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,014
point of view. There are a few generalists, but they realize

224
00:15:40,062 --> 00:15:43,850
the human body is so complicated that no one mind can understand it.

225
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,654
And furthermore, supposing we do succeed in healing

226
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:52,654
all these people of their diseases, what do

227
00:15:52,662 --> 00:15:56,110
we then do about the population problem? I mean,

228
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,902
we've stopped cholera, the black bubonic plague.

229
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:03,934
We're getting the better of tuberculosis. We may fix cancer and heart disease.

230
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:07,502
Then what will people die of? Well, then, let's go

231
00:16:07,526 --> 00:16:11,210
on living. There'll be enormous quantities of us.

232
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,526
Then we have to fix this birthing pills

233
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,934
for everybody. Then we find what are the

234
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:22,854
effects, the side effects of those pills. What are the psychological

235
00:16:22,902 --> 00:16:26,790
effects upon men and women of not breeding children in the usual

236
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:30,210
way? We don't know.

237
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,102
And what seems a good thing today or yesterday,

238
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:40,110
like ddt, turns out tomorrow to have been a disaster.

239
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,290
What seemed in the moral and spiritual sphere too,

240
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,710
like great virtues in times past,

241
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,762
are easily seen today as hideous

242
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:56,730
evils. Let's take, for example, the Inquisition in its own

243
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,538
day. Among Catholics, the Holy Inquisition was

244
00:17:00,594 --> 00:17:03,386
regarded as we today,

245
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,089
regardless the practice of psychiatry,

246
00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:11,013
you, you see, you, you feel that in curing a person of cancer,

247
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:14,357
almost anything is justified. The most

248
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:17,849
complex operations, the most weird surgery,

249
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:21,929
people suspended for days and days on end, on the end of tubes

250
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:27,289
with X ray penetration burning,

251
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:31,980
or people undergoing shock treatment, people locked

252
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,772
in the colorless, monotonous corridors

253
00:17:35,836 --> 00:17:39,308
of mental institutions. In all

254
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:43,212
good faith, they knew that witchcraft and heresy

255
00:17:43,276 --> 00:17:47,788
were terrible things, awful plagues

256
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:51,740
imperiling people's souls forever and ever. So any

257
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,292
means were justified to cure people of

258
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:59,450
heresy. We don't change.

259
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,650
We're doing the same thing today,

260
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:07,502
but under different names. We can look

261
00:18:07,526 --> 00:18:11,022
back at those people and see how evil that was, but we can't see

262
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:12,050
it in ourselves.

263
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,770
So therefore, beware of virtue.

264
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,280
Lao Tzu, the Chinese philosopher, said the highest

265
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,024
virtue is not virtue and therefore

266
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:35,104
really is virtue. But inferior virtue

267
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:38,480
cannot let go of being virtuous and therefore is not

268
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,300
virtue.

269
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,100
Translated in more of a periphrastic way.

270
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,696
The highest virtue is not conscious of itself as virtue,

271
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,940
and therefore really is virtue.

272
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,100
Lower virtue is so self conscious that it's not virtue.

273
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,420
In other words, when you breathe,

274
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,980
you don't congratulate yourself on being virtuous.

275
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,940
But breathing is a great virtue. It's living.

276
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,900
When you come out with beautiful eyes,

277
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,030
blue or brown or green, as the case may Be you

278
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,934
don't congratulate yourself for having grown one of the most fabulous

279
00:19:23,982 --> 00:19:28,210
jewels on earth, just eyes.

280
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,810
And you don't account it a virtue to see,

281
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,662
to entertain the miracles of color and form. You say,

282
00:19:37,686 --> 00:19:41,888
oh, that's just, but that's real virtue.

283
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:45,500
Virtue in the sense, the old sense of the word, a strength

284
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,400
is when we talk about the healing virtue of a plant,

285
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,640
that's real virtue.

286
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,828
But the other virtues are stuck on their ersats,

287
00:19:56,924 --> 00:19:58,720
their imitation virtues.

288
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,572
And they usually create trouble because

289
00:20:06,676 --> 00:20:10,042
more diabolical things are done in

290
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:13,450
the name of righteousness. And be assured that

291
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,890
everybody of whatever nationality or political frame of

292
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,234
mind or religion always goes

293
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:23,530
to war with a sense of complete

294
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,070
rightness. The other side is the devil.

295
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,498
Our opponents, whether in

296
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:37,222
China or Russia or Vietnam, have the

297
00:20:37,246 --> 00:20:41,250
same feeling of righteousness about what they're doing as we have on our side

298
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,170
and a plague on both houses.

299
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:53,078
Because as Confucius said,

300
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:56,330
the goody goodies are the thieves of virtue.

301
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,740
Which is the form of our own proverb. The road to hell is

302
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:30,714
paved with good intentions inspired.

303
00:21:30,842 --> 00:21:34,826
Consider this a quick reminder. God playing hide and seek. My mission

304
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:38,202
is to find other. So then, here's the

305
00:21:38,226 --> 00:21:41,834
drama. My metaphysics, let me be perfectly

306
00:21:41,882 --> 00:21:46,202
frank with you, are that there is the

307
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:49,670
central self. You can call it God, you can call it anything you like,

308
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,708
and it's all of us. It's playing all

309
00:21:54,764 --> 00:21:58,212
the parts of all beings whatsoever,

310
00:21:58,356 --> 00:22:00,280
everywhere and anywhere,

311
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,876
and it's playing the game of hide and seek with itself. It gets

312
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,400
lost, it gets involved in the farest out adventures,

313
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,372
but in the end it always wakes up and comes back to

314
00:22:14,396 --> 00:22:18,116
itself. And when you are ready to wake

315
00:22:18,148 --> 00:22:21,192
up, you're going to wake up, wake up. And if you're not ready, you're going

316
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:24,900
to stay pretending that you're just a little poor little me.

317
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,536
And since you're all here and engaged in this sort

318
00:22:30,568 --> 00:22:34,056
of inquiry and listening to this sort of lecture, I assume that you're

319
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:36,100
all on the process of waking up.

320
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,880
Or else you're teasing yourselves with

321
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,950
some kind of flirtation with waking up,

322
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,450
which you're not serious about, but I assume

323
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,870
maybe you are not serious but sincere,

324
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,018
that you are ready to wake up. So then

325
00:22:58,154 --> 00:23:01,538
when you're in the way of waking up and finding out who you really

326
00:23:01,594 --> 00:23:03,910
are, you meet a character called a guru,

327
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,106
as the Hindus say this word, the teacher, the awakener.

328
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:12,902
And what is the function of a guru? He's the man who

329
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:16,326
looks at you in the eye and says,

330
00:23:16,398 --> 00:23:19,782
oh, come on, I know

331
00:23:19,806 --> 00:23:22,902
who you are. You know, you come to the guru and say, sir, I have

332
00:23:22,926 --> 00:23:26,214
a problem, I'm unhappy and I want

333
00:23:26,222 --> 00:23:29,462
to get one up on the universe or I want to become enlightened, I want

334
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:33,090
spiritual wisdom. Ah. The guru looks at you and says,

335
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,048
who are you? You know, Sri Ramana

336
00:23:38,064 --> 00:23:41,280
Maharshi, that great Hindu sage of

337
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,752
modern times. People used to come to him and say, master, who was

338
00:23:44,776 --> 00:23:48,288
I in my last incarnation? As if that mattered.

339
00:23:48,464 --> 00:23:51,260
And he would say, who is asking the question?

340
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,496
He'd look at you and say, basically go right down to it.

341
00:23:56,568 --> 00:24:00,032
You're looking at me, you're looking out and you're unaware of

342
00:24:00,056 --> 00:24:04,042
what's behind your eyes. Go back in and

343
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:07,418
find out who you are, where the question comes from, why you

344
00:24:07,474 --> 00:24:11,242
ask. And if you've looked at a photograph of

345
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:15,242
that man, I have a gorgeous photograph and you

346
00:24:15,266 --> 00:24:17,610
look in those. I walk by it every time I go out of the front

347
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:21,790
door. Look at those eyes and the humor

348
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,550
lilting laugh that says, oh, come off it,

349
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,532
Shiva. I recognize you when

350
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:38,020
you come to my door and you say, I'm so

351
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,492
and so. I say, haha, what a funny way God has come on

352
00:24:41,516 --> 00:24:42,080
today.

353
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,640
There are all sorts of tricks, of course, that gurus play.

354
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,068
They say,

355
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:57,410
well, we're going to put you through the mill.

356
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:02,330
And the reason they do that is simply that you

357
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,142
won't wake up until you

358
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,930
feel you've paid a price for it.

359
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,726
In other words, the sense of guilt that one has or the sense

360
00:25:13,758 --> 00:25:18,334
of anxiety is simply the way one experiences

361
00:25:18,462 --> 00:25:21,290
keeping the game of disguise going on.

362
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:29,050
Do you see that? Supposing you say I feel guilty,

363
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,650
Christianity makes you feel guilty for existing,

364
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:39,210
that somehow the very fact that you exist is an affront.

365
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:43,062
You are a fallen human being.

366
00:25:43,246 --> 00:25:46,790
I remember as a child when we went to the services of the church on

367
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:51,658
Good Friday, they gave us each a colored postcard

368
00:25:51,754 --> 00:25:55,130
with Jesus crucified on it. And it said

369
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:59,430
underneath this have I done for thee. What doest thou for me?

370
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:05,178
You know you felt awful. You nailed that man to the cross

371
00:26:05,354 --> 00:26:09,338
because you eat steak. You have crucified Christ because

372
00:26:09,394 --> 00:26:12,230
you kill the bull. After all, you depend on it.

373
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,720
Mithra. It's the same mystery.

374
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,028
And what are you going to do about that? This have I done for thee?

375
00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:24,240
What dost thou for me? You feel awful that you just exist at all.

376
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,364
But that sense, that sense of guilt is

377
00:26:31,532 --> 00:26:35,668
the veil across

378
00:26:35,724 --> 00:26:42,072
the sanctuary. Don't you dare come in in

379
00:26:42,096 --> 00:26:45,992
order to. You know, in all mysteries when you're going to be initiated,

380
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:49,560
there's somebody saying, don't you come

381
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,064
in, you got to fulfill this requirement, at this requirement,

382
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:56,340
of this requirement, of this requirement, then we'll let you in.

383
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,020
And so you go, you, you go through the mill

384
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,350
while. Why?

385
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,310
Because this is. You are saying to yourself,

386
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,270
I won't wake up until I feel I deserve it.

387
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,550
I won't wake up until I've made it difficult for me to wake up.

388
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:24,034
So I, I. I invent for myself an elaborate

389
00:27:24,082 --> 00:27:26,350
system of delaying my waking up.

390
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,962
I put myself through this test and that test, and when I feel it's been

391
00:27:30,986 --> 00:27:34,434
sufficiently arduous, then I may at last admit to myself

392
00:27:34,482 --> 00:27:38,050
who I. And draw aside the veil

393
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,010
and realize that after all,

394
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,330
when all is said and done,

395
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:50,942
I am that I am, which is

396
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:52,050
the name of God.

397
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,702
And when it comes to it, that's really rather fun. They say

398
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:04,070
in Zen, when you attain satori, nothing is left you

399
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,930
at that moment but to have a good laugh.

400
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,990
But naturally, all masters,

401
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,598
Zen masters, yoga masters, every kind of master puts

402
00:28:16,614 --> 00:28:20,230
up a barrier and

403
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,330
says to you,

404
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,752
simply plays your own game. You know, we say anybody who

405
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:33,300
goes to a psychiatrist ought to have his head examined.

406
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,312
Because you, when you go to a psychiatrist, you define yourself as

407
00:28:39,336 --> 00:28:41,140
somebody who ought to have his head examined.

408
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,152
Same way the Zen masters say anybody who studies

409
00:28:47,216 --> 00:28:50,384
Zen or comes to a Zen master ought to be given 30 blows with a

410
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:53,706
stick because he was stupid

411
00:28:53,738 --> 00:28:57,590
enough to pose the question that he had a problem.

412
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,922
But you're the problem. You, you put yourself in

413
00:29:02,946 --> 00:29:03,790
this situation.

414
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,730
So it's a question fundamentally, do you define yourself as

415
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:14,150
a victim of the world or as the world

416
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,940
sa.

417
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:57,114
You can't transform yourself. You can't

418
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:00,506
make yourself sane. You can't make yourself loving.

419
00:30:00,618 --> 00:30:03,070
You can't make yourself unselfish.

420
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,810
And yet it's absolutely necessary that we be that

421
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,520
way. It's absolutely necessary

422
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,700
if we are going to hand over the

423
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,852
direction of nature to nature, which is

424
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:24,680
what it comes to. It's absolutely necessary

425
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,720
that we let go of ourselves. And it can't be done,

426
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,794
not by anything that we call doing it. Acting willing

427
00:30:34,892 --> 00:30:38,462
or even just accepting things. You can't do it.

428
00:30:38,646 --> 00:30:42,558
Why? Because you don't really exist

429
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:45,758
as that kind of a separate ego or personality.

430
00:30:45,854 --> 00:30:49,010
It's just an idea based on a phony feeling.

431
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,610
So when it comes down to it,

432
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,210
it's shocking news for us,

433
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,260
for the human race, for our pride.

434
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,296
You're only making a mess by trying to put things

435
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:11,480
straight. You're trying to straighten out

436
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,220
a wiggly world, and no wonder you're in trouble.

437
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,464
So you can't do Anything. So you can't

438
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:23,620
transform yourself. And what can you do?

439
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,580
What happens then? If you actually realize you've come to a dead end

440
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,860
and the human race has come to a dead end, in my opinion,

441
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,980
what then? Commit suicide?

442
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,608
Or is there something else? What happens

443
00:31:43,784 --> 00:31:46,660
when you just wait? There's nothing you can do.

444
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,456
You watch and

445
00:31:52,528 --> 00:31:55,800
all you see is what goes on, that that is happening of

446
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,780
itself. You are breathing,

447
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,500
the wind is blowing, the trees are waving.

448
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,352
Your blood is circulating, your nerves are tingling.

449
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:09,260
It's all going on with itself.

450
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,660
Would you know that's you, that's the real you,

451
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,580
the you that goes on of itself.

452
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,790
It's not the symbol,

453
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:29,538
it's not the person, it's you

454
00:32:29,594 --> 00:32:32,754
that's happening. As when you breathe. Yes,

455
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:36,530
you can get the feeling that I am breathing by shoving your breath.

456
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,950
But your breath goes on day in and day out

457
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:44,162
without you doing anything about it or even thinking of it. The same way

458
00:32:44,186 --> 00:32:46,750
your brain is functioning without your forcing it.

459
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:52,210
So when you come to a dead end, and we are individually and

460
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,430
socially now in 1971,

461
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,670
at a dead end,

462
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,954
this is the moment of which it is said man's extremity

463
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:08,418
is God's opportunity because

464
00:33:08,474 --> 00:33:11,826
we have to stop. And when we stop,

465
00:33:11,898 --> 00:33:15,732
we find a world that is happening rather than

466
00:33:15,836 --> 00:33:18,040
being done, being shoved.

467
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,660
And that happening, as distinct from

468
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,196
doing, is our fundamental self. And our fundamental

469
00:33:26,228 --> 00:33:28,680
self is not something just inside the skin.

470
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,660
It's everything around us with which we

471
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,052
connect. When you look out of

472
00:33:38,076 --> 00:33:41,604
your eyes at nature happening

473
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,360
out there, you're looking at you.

474
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:49,270
I'm not going to say what we should do from then on,

475
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,258
but simply that before we

476
00:33:55,314 --> 00:33:59,550
think of doing anything in this critical situation,

477
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:05,930
we realize the completely illusory nature

478
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,780
of the beings that we think we are and

479
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,220
get back again to the beings that we

480
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,960
really are, which includes

481
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:24,180
all this outside

482
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,440
world no longer left outside.

483
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:58,180
I was explaining the

484
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,854
problem of how we thoughts

485
00:35:01,902 --> 00:35:05,630
protect us from truth and what to do about

486
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,570
it. Showing various ways

487
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,982
in which the symbolizing process, which we

488
00:35:14,006 --> 00:35:17,550
call thinking, the use of signs,

489
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,290
words, symbols, numbers to represent

490
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:25,810
what's going on in the external world or the world of nature.

491
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:32,390
It leads us into a curious confusion that

492
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,310
we confuse the symbolic process

493
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,630
with the actual world.

494
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:44,394
And the temptation to do this arises from the extraordinary

495
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:49,230
relative success that we have had in controlling

496
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:52,230
the world of nature with the power of thought.

497
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,044
But I don't know if it's ever struck you that we really don't

498
00:35:57,092 --> 00:36:00,240
know whether we have successfully controlled it or not.

499
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,020
It could be argued a very strong case could be made that

500
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,132
the entire intellectual venture of civilization has

501
00:36:10,156 --> 00:36:11,800
been a ghastly mistake.

502
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,920
And that we are now on a collision course.

503
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,520
And that all the vaunted benefits of intelligence,

504
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:25,018
technology and all that is

505
00:36:25,074 --> 00:36:28,522
simply going to draw the human race to an extremely

506
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:32,010
swift conclusion. Of course, that might not be a bad

507
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,834
thing. I've sometimes speculated

508
00:36:35,882 --> 00:36:39,630
on the idea that all stars

509
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,350
have been created out of planets.

510
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:51,430
You. You can't. You can't even imagine such a state of affairs

511
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:57,026
because you know it's

512
00:36:57,058 --> 00:36:57,750
relative.

513
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:03,042
You have one row of caratids supporting a floor.

514
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:06,946
Very soon your children are the next row of carriages supporting

515
00:37:06,978 --> 00:37:10,098
another floor. So that it gets higher and

516
00:37:10,154 --> 00:37:13,270
higher and. But we don't really know where we began.

517
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,590
And we're always in the same place,

518
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:20,202
always hoping, always thinking that the

519
00:37:20,226 --> 00:37:23,642
next time will be it. And this,

520
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:27,910
of course, is an eternal illusion. It's much better,

521
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:32,650
actually. One would be much happier to think that

522
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:36,350
there is. The future is simply deteriorating.

523
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,470
I can explain that very simply.

524
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,184
Human beings are largely

525
00:37:44,232 --> 00:37:47,992
engaged in wasting enormous amounts of

526
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:51,820
psychic energy. In attempting to do things that are quite impossible.

527
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,512
You know, as the proverb says, you can't lift yourself up by your

528
00:37:57,536 --> 00:38:01,288
own bootstraps. But recently I've heard a lot of references

529
00:38:01,384 --> 00:38:04,952
in just general reading and listening where people say, we've got to

530
00:38:04,976 --> 00:38:08,750
lift ourselves up by our own boots, bootstraps. And you can't.

531
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:13,226
And you can struggle and tug and pull till you're blue in the face

532
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:16,510
and nothing happens except that you exhausted yourself.

533
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:20,810
And the more we try,

534
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,310
you see, to put everything to rights,

535
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:29,242
the more we make fantastic misses and it

536
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:33,030
gets worse. And maybe that's the way it's got to be.

537
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,280
Maybe I shouldn't say anything at all.

538
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,532
Don't take me too seriously. I'm pitching a

539
00:38:43,556 --> 00:38:47,244
case for the fact that the civilization has been a

540
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:50,492
mistake. That it would be

541
00:38:50,516 --> 00:38:52,640
much better to leave everything alone.

542
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,516
That the wild animals

543
00:38:57,628 --> 00:39:01,330
are wiser than we in that

544
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:04,882
they putting it in our crude and

545
00:39:04,906 --> 00:39:07,590
not very exact language. They just follow their instincts.

546
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:12,850
Now, we who look before and after and predict and

547
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:16,466
are always concerned whether this generation is going to be better or worse

548
00:39:16,498 --> 00:39:19,430
than the one that came before. We are tormented.

549
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,670
And we just don't realize,

550
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,268
because of this tremendous preoccupation with

551
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,612
time, we don't realize how beautiful we

552
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:34,972
are. Give me a

553
00:39:34,996 --> 00:39:37,800
falcrum and I will move the earth. But there isn't one.

554
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,680
It's like, you know, betting on the future of the human race.

555
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,868
If I were really smart, I would lay a bet. The human

556
00:39:45,924 --> 00:39:49,068
race will destroy itself. But the trouble is, there's nowhere

557
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:50,120
to place the bet.

558
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:56,614
And so, since I can't place the bed anywhere I'm involved

559
00:39:56,662 --> 00:39:59,990
in the world must,

560
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:04,054
of course, try to see that it doesn't blow itself

561
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:04,890
to pieces.

562
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:11,606
Part of you which is supposed to improve you is exactly

563
00:40:11,638 --> 00:40:14,650
the same as that part of you which needs to be improved.

564
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,888
In other words, there isn't any real distinction between bad me

565
00:40:22,024 --> 00:40:25,700
and good I, between the higher self,

566
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,020
which is spiritual, and the lower self, which is animal.

567
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,112
It's all of a piece. You are this organism, this integrated,

568
00:40:34,256 --> 00:40:36,100
fascinating energy pattern.

569
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,928
All sensible people, therefore, begin in life

570
00:40:42,984 --> 00:40:45,570
with two fundamental presuppos positions.

571
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:52,942
You are not going to improve the world, and you are not going

572
00:40:52,966 --> 00:40:54,210
to improve yourself.

573
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:11,050
You are just what you are Sa.

574
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:40,850
Give me some of that. Give me some of that.

575
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,846
When you are perfectly free to feel stuck or

576
00:41:57,918 --> 00:42:00,330
not stuck, then you're unstuck.

577
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,220
Because actually nothing can stick

578
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,640
on the real mind. And you will

579
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,500
find this out if you watch the flow of your thoughts.

580
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,928
There is an expression in Chinese which

581
00:42:23,064 --> 00:42:26,448
means the flow of thoughts, or what we call in

582
00:42:26,504 --> 00:42:29,194
literary criticism, stream of consciousness.

583
00:42:29,322 --> 00:42:32,506
And they put the character for thought three times,

584
00:42:32,658 --> 00:42:34,110
nyan, nyan, nyan.

585
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:39,850
And so you will notice that thought

586
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:44,430
follows thought follows thought when you are just ruminating.

587
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:49,466
And those thoughts arise and

588
00:42:49,538 --> 00:42:53,050
go like waves on the water all the time,

589
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:56,530
they come and go, and when

590
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:00,190
they go, they are as if they had never been here.

591
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:06,710
So actually, this shows your mind doesn't stick,

592
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:11,570
really. You can get the illusion of it sticking by,

593
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:15,042
for example, cycling the same succession of thoughts over

594
00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:19,192
and over again. And that gives a sense of permanence

595
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:22,268
in the same way as when you revolve a cigarette butt in the dark.

596
00:43:22,364 --> 00:43:25,964
You get the illusion of there being a solid circle, although there is

597
00:43:25,972 --> 00:43:27,720
only the single point of fire.

598
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,280
And it is from this connecting of thoughts

599
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:38,236
that we get the sensation that behind our thoughts

600
00:43:38,428 --> 00:43:42,460
there is a thinker who controls them and

601
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,990
experiences them. Although the

602
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:49,542
notion that there is a thinker is just one member in

603
00:43:49,566 --> 00:43:52,806
the stream of thoughts. For example,

604
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:56,198
if you get a certain kind of rhythm that goes diggity diggy diggity diggy boop,

605
00:43:56,214 --> 00:43:58,170
diggy diggy diggity diggity boop.

606
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:03,830
The boop is part of the rhythm,

607
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:08,330
but it can be used as a cue.

608
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:13,842
So you get in relation to diggy diggy diggy diggy boop.

609
00:44:13,906 --> 00:44:17,618
You get thought, thought, thought, thought, thinker, thought, thought, thought, thought, thought, thinker.

610
00:44:17,714 --> 00:44:22,066
And if this happens regularly enough and long enough, you get the illusion

611
00:44:22,178 --> 00:44:25,506
of There being someone who thinks apart

612
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:29,410
from the stream of thoughts which come and go, the stream of experiences.

613
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:33,714
And we use such absurd phrases not only as thinking our thoughts,

614
00:44:33,842 --> 00:44:37,738
but feeling our feelings, seeing, see sights and hearing sounds.

615
00:44:37,914 --> 00:44:42,266
But you must understand, it is perfectly obvious that seeing a sight is seeing,

616
00:44:42,378 --> 00:44:46,010
hearing a sound is hearing, feeling a feeling is

617
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,322
feeling. So in the same way thinking a

618
00:44:49,346 --> 00:44:53,386
thought is thinking, but you get split minded,

619
00:44:53,418 --> 00:44:56,922
you see, and so you get I and me and the

620
00:44:56,946 --> 00:45:00,870
I who ought to or must control me as

621
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:06,100
sensation of some real entity that

622
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,036
stands aside from thoughts and chooses

623
00:45:10,068 --> 00:45:13,520
among them, controls them, regulates them,

624
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,600
and so on. Actually,

625
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,400
this is a way to have one's thoughts not controlled.

626
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:27,310
The more there is this duality of

627
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:31,262
the separate thinker standing aside from the thoughts,

628
00:45:31,406 --> 00:45:35,490
the separate feeler watching or feeling the feelings,

629
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:39,970
the more the stream of feelings is coaxed

630
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,770
into self protective activity,

631
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:47,646
into getting more and more like a stuck record, the purposes

632
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:52,690
of which are to protect and to aggrandize

633
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:56,930
and enlarge the status of the supposed thinker.

634
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:04,770
When Joshu, who was a Tang dynasty Zen master,

635
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:09,934
was asked, he had made some reference to the enlightened

636
00:46:09,982 --> 00:46:12,330
mind being like a mind of a child.

637
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:16,638
And he said, well, what is the mind of a child? And he

638
00:46:16,694 --> 00:46:18,450
said, a ball in a mountain stream.

639
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:24,146
Why, thought follows thought instantaneously

640
00:46:24,258 --> 00:46:25,750
without interruption.

641
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:33,618
So the saying, walk or sit

642
00:46:33,674 --> 00:46:37,430
as you will, but whatever you do, don't wobble.

643
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:44,922
Now, we can see this very clearly from confusions. We can get into

644
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:46,350
inactivity.

645
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:52,714
I have just said we can see this very clearly from confusions.

646
00:46:52,762 --> 00:46:54,510
We get into inactivity.

647
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,870
What kind of a statement is that?

648
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:07,530
When I raise the question, what kind of a statement was it that I just

649
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:10,270
made? I'm beginning to talk about talking.

650
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,984
And one can do that provided you don't try to

651
00:47:15,992 --> 00:47:18,380
do it while you're making the original statement.

652
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,448
If I want to say something about what I've just said,

653
00:47:24,584 --> 00:47:28,380
then I must do it later, mustn't I? But not at the same time.

654
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,896
I cannot say, you are a fool, and at the same time

655
00:47:32,968 --> 00:47:40,712
say, I am giving you an insult. In so many words I

656
00:47:40,736 --> 00:47:44,312
cannot say, or in mathematics I cannot

657
00:47:44,376 --> 00:47:47,960
write down a certain equation and as I am writing it down,

658
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,860
simultaneously state what kind of an equation this is.

659
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,512
Unless, of course, I invent an exceedingly complex language

660
00:47:57,656 --> 00:48:00,420
which talks about itself as it goes along,

661
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:06,082
but in the ordinary way, people get completely mixed up by that.

662
00:48:06,266 --> 00:48:10,738
In the middle of being about to say to somebody anything,

663
00:48:10,914 --> 00:48:14,082
you start to think about whether this is the right thing to say

664
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,682
and you start wobbling. You get,

665
00:48:17,706 --> 00:48:19,670
in other words, too much feedback.

666
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:25,670
And too much feedback makes any mechanism go crazy.

667
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,680
So in the same way, when you are very, very aware

668
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:36,000
of a difference between the deeds and the doer.

669
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:40,060
And the doer, while doing the deeds, is always sort of commenting on them,

670
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,440
the doer never really gets with it.

671
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,120
In other words, you are about to strike a nail,

672
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,840
and you wonder as you are about to hit it,

673
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,400
is this the right place to put it?

674
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,564
And so you probably hit your thumbnail

675
00:48:58,612 --> 00:49:01,940
instead of the nail because you

676
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,120
don't go right through with hitting that nail.

677
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,668
This is not saying. Let me mark this again. It is not

678
00:49:09,724 --> 00:49:13,332
saying that there should be no criticism

679
00:49:13,396 --> 00:49:17,060
of thought. But if you

680
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,910
criticize thought, one thinking as if there were

681
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,730
a critic, thinker standing aside from the stream of thought,

682
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,846
then you get all balled up. And that is exactly

683
00:49:28,878 --> 00:49:33,278
what happens in the process of attachment,

684
00:49:33,454 --> 00:49:36,610
or what are called in Buddhist klesha,

685
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:41,070
which mean disturbing confusions of the

686
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:44,548
mind. And you see, this kind of confusion

687
00:49:44,694 --> 00:49:49,260
is something which. To which the human organism is peculiarly liable.

688
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,580
Because the human organism has language,

689
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,900
has. You see, thinking is silent language.

690
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,576
And I mean language in the most inclusive sense of the word.

691
00:50:01,688 --> 00:50:04,952
Not only words, but also images and numbers,

692
00:50:05,096 --> 00:50:08,632
notation. Just because then we

693
00:50:08,656 --> 00:50:12,436
can talk about anything. We can talk about talking,

694
00:50:12,628 --> 00:50:15,720
we can talk about thinking, we can talk about ourselves.

695
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:19,844
As if we could stand aside and say, said I To myself,

696
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:24,532
Said I. All we are actually doing is

697
00:50:24,636 --> 00:50:29,060
making a second thought or thought stream

698
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,680
which comments on the one that went before.

699
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:36,174
And then pretending that the second stream is a

700
00:50:36,182 --> 00:50:37,770
different stream than the first.

701
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:43,790
That's because there are built into our minds all kinds of phony

702
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:47,678
images about memory. We think, for example,

703
00:50:47,774 --> 00:50:50,290
of memory by analogy with engraving.

704
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:54,090
In order to remember something, we write it down.

705
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:58,702
And so we have a flat and stable piece of paper, and we

706
00:50:58,726 --> 00:51:01,770
make marks on it with a pencil. And they stay there.

707
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:06,508
So we begin to think. Is mental memory something of the same kind?

708
00:51:06,644 --> 00:51:10,440
Is there something stable upon which the

709
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:14,320
passage of thoughts makes an impression?

710
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,840
We say, he impressed me very much.

711
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,440
This was a lasting impression on my mind,

712
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:28,444
as if we were tablets. Indeed, the philosopher locked

713
00:51:28,602 --> 00:51:32,700
use the expression tabula rasa, or clean slate,

714
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,840
to describe the mind of a child. This is a mind which

715
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,472
has not yet collected any memories, as if there were

716
00:51:40,656 --> 00:51:44,680
some sort of surface which

717
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,176
accumulated these things and preserved

718
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:52,792
them. And that's me. But you see,

719
00:51:52,896 --> 00:51:56,602
this superstition is related to

720
00:51:56,626 --> 00:52:00,950
a much more ancient superstition that the world

721
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:04,762
consists of two elements, one of

722
00:52:04,786 --> 00:52:07,990
which is stuff. And the other of which is form.

723
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:13,274
This is a myth based on a model of

724
00:52:13,282 --> 00:52:17,390
the world which is fundamentally ceramic.

725
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:19,870
God,

726
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,700
what there is is you. And that should

727
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:33,760
be absolutely obvious, but it is not obvious at all.

728
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,360
That should be the simplest thing in the world.

729
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:42,500
That you, the I, is what has

730
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,604
always been going on and always will go on forever

731
00:52:45,652 --> 00:52:46,400
and ever.

732
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:55,158
But we have been bamboozled by

733
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:59,530
religionists, by politicians,

734
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:03,430
by fathers and mothers, by all sorts of people

735
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:06,530
to tell us you're not it.

736
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,370
And we believed it.

737
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:17,310
So do you see now why if I put it to you

738
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:21,230
in this very negative way,

739
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:25,842
you can't do anything to change yourselves, to become better,

740
00:53:26,026 --> 00:53:29,122
to become happier, to become more serene,

741
00:53:29,266 --> 00:53:32,802
to become mystics or anything. If I say you

742
00:53:32,826 --> 00:53:34,270
can't do a damn thing,

743
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,640
can you understand this negative statement in a positive way?

744
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,560
What I'm really saying is that you don't need to,

745
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:56,040
because if you see yourselves in the correct way,

746
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:00,716
you are all as much extraordinary phenomena

747
00:54:00,748 --> 00:54:03,638
of nature as,

748
00:54:03,694 --> 00:54:07,526
say, trees, clouds, the patterns

749
00:54:07,558 --> 00:54:11,462
in running water, the shape of fire, the arrangement of

750
00:54:11,486 --> 00:54:15,350
the stars, the form of a galaxy. You are all just like

751
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:15,970
that.

752
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:27,730
There's nothing wrong with you at all.

753
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,740
Except that I have to add this little flip.

754
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,620
You, you, you have in you. You do think there's something wrong.

755
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,672
See, then there's no question you do.

756
00:54:41,856 --> 00:54:45,208
We all object to ourselves in various ways. And I'm

757
00:54:45,224 --> 00:54:47,900
going to add, there's nothing wrong with that either,

758
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,592
because that's part of the flow. That's part of what is going on. That's part

759
00:54:53,616 --> 00:54:54,660
of what we do.

760
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:02,674
So I don't. You see, what I'm actually going

761
00:55:02,682 --> 00:55:06,898
to do is I'm going to deliver you from a sense of guilt because

762
00:55:06,954 --> 00:55:10,978
I'm going to teach you that you needn't feel

763
00:55:11,034 --> 00:55:12,950
guilty because you feel guilty.

764
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:20,150
Of course you feel guilty.

765
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,600
It's like someone put a match on you and you feel hot.

766
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:28,460
So they taught you as a child to feel guilty and you feel guilty.

767
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:31,600
You say, well, if someone comes along and says, well, you shouldn't,

768
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,840
that's not the point.

769
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,716
I'm going to say not that you shouldn't,

770
00:55:38,908 --> 00:55:41,320
but that you do and don't worry about it.

771
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:47,116
And if you want to say further, but I can't help worrying about it,

772
00:55:47,188 --> 00:55:49,990
I'm going to say to you, okay, worry about it.

773
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:53,870
This is the principle called in Japanese judo,

774
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:58,602
meaning the gentle way. Go along with it, go along with it,

775
00:55:58,626 --> 00:55:59,750
go along with it.

776
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:09,630
So, therefore, this is the beginning of meditation.

777
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,270
You don't know what you're supposed to do.

778
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:18,640
What can you do? Well, if you don't know what you're supposed to do,

779
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,040
you watch.

780
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,000
You simply watch what's going on.

781
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,040
Like say somebody plays music,

782
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:38,440
you listen and you just follow those sounds

783
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:45,130
and eventually you understand the point of the music.

784
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:50,062
The point cannot be explained in words because music is

785
00:56:50,086 --> 00:56:50,930
not words.

786
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:56,414
But after a while, in listening to any music,

787
00:56:56,582 --> 00:57:02,062
you will understand the point of it and

788
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:04,290
that point will be the music itself.

789
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,818
I have often puzzled and puzzled about

790
00:57:30,874 --> 00:57:34,514
what it must be like to go to sleep

791
00:57:34,562 --> 00:57:38,670
and never wake up. To be

792
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:43,230
simply not there forever and ever

793
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:48,642
after all, one has some intimation of

794
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:52,050
this by the interval that separates going

795
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:55,522
to sleep from waking. When we don't have

796
00:57:55,546 --> 00:57:59,042
any dreams but go to sleep and

797
00:57:59,066 --> 00:58:02,230
then suddenly we're there again and in the interim

798
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:07,026
there was nothing. And if

799
00:58:07,178 --> 00:58:09,970
there was never any end to that interval,

800
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:12,110
if the waking up didn't happen,

801
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,110
that's such a curious thought.

802
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:21,106
And yet, you know, I believe that although that's

803
00:58:21,138 --> 00:58:24,400
rather gloomy kind of consideration,

804
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:28,460
I found that's one of the most creative thoughts I

805
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,040
ever thought in my life. And I keep going back to it.

806
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:37,884
You know, it's in line with a lot of the very fundamental

807
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:41,980
questions that children ask when they

808
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:45,692
say, mummy, who would I have been if you had

809
00:58:45,716 --> 00:58:46,960
married someone else?

810
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:53,838
These are the kind of questions that make

811
00:58:53,894 --> 00:58:57,090
us puzzle profoundly about our existence.

812
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:02,126
And one of the reasons why I think thinking about not

813
00:59:02,198 --> 00:59:06,398
being about total non existence is

814
00:59:06,454 --> 00:59:10,862
so creative is that in comparison

815
00:59:10,926 --> 00:59:14,638
with that thought, the fact that we

816
00:59:14,694 --> 00:59:18,596
are seems kind of queer,

817
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:20,280
incredibly odd.

818
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:28,324
But you know, in the Western world I suppose

819
00:59:28,372 --> 00:59:32,100
we have two dominant ideas about

820
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:35,460
what happens to us when we die. There's the

821
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,932
old fashioned idea that after

822
00:59:38,956 --> 00:59:40,880
we die we go to another world.

823
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:45,432
I say old fashioned, not to say it's out of date. We don't know what

824
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:46,820
the answer to this is,

825
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,576
but that's the traditional answer of the Western world.

826
00:59:51,728 --> 00:59:54,648
When you die, you go to another life. Maybe heaven,

827
00:59:54,744 --> 00:59:57,820
maybe purgatory, maybe hell, who knows?

828
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:03,064
I think nowadays though, the more general idea, the more plausible

829
01:00:03,112 --> 01:00:07,112
idea to many people, is that when we die we

830
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:09,570
just cease to be. That's all there is to it.

831
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:13,766
But we're inclined, I think, to have in our minds a picture

832
01:00:13,798 --> 01:00:17,318
of this which indeed is depressed of being

833
01:00:17,374 --> 01:00:20,982
shut up in the dark for always and always and always to

834
01:00:21,006 --> 01:00:24,422
be kind of buried alive in a blackness where we are

835
01:00:24,446 --> 01:00:28,170
blind, deaf and dumb, but somehow still conscious.

836
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:33,900
But in the Eastern world there

837
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:36,200
are different ideas of this.

838
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:43,708
The major Eastern idea is what is generally known as

839
01:00:43,764 --> 01:00:47,516
reincarnation of going through

840
01:00:47,588 --> 01:00:50,680
life after life after life in an endless series.

841
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,644
Now, of course, when any idea

842
01:00:55,692 --> 01:00:59,728
like that is explained, the first thing that we ask is,

843
01:00:59,784 --> 01:01:00,740
is it true?

844
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,940
Is there a process of rebirth?

845
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:12,336
But you know, as this idea is held by

846
01:01:12,408 --> 01:01:15,120
deeply thoughtful Hindus and Buddhists,

847
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,424
it isn't a belief in something which we can't prove. It's really

848
01:01:19,512 --> 01:01:23,232
quite a self evident notion. Think of it in

849
01:01:23,256 --> 01:01:26,340
this way. Supposing I make two statements.

850
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,860
Statement one, after I die,

851
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,792
I shall be reborn again as

852
01:01:35,816 --> 01:01:39,980
a baby, but I shall forget my former life.

853
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,980
Statement two, after I die,

854
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,460
a baby will be born.

855
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,280
Now, I believe that those two statements are saying exactly the same

856
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,612
thing. And we know that the second one is

857
01:01:56,636 --> 01:02:00,804
true. Babies are always being born. Conscious beings of all kinds

858
01:02:00,852 --> 01:02:04,276
are constantly coming into existence after others

859
01:02:04,348 --> 01:02:07,840
die. But why would I think

860
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:12,000
that the two statements are really the same statement?

861
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:17,380
Because after all, if you

862
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:21,070
die and your memory comes to an end end and you forget who you

863
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:25,150
were, being reborn again is exactly the equivalent of

864
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:29,166
somebody else being born. Because we have no consciousness

865
01:02:29,198 --> 01:02:32,862
of our continuity unless we have memory. If the memory goes,

866
01:02:33,006 --> 01:02:35,410
then we might just as well be somebody else.

867
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:40,526
But it seems to me that the fascinating thing about this

868
01:02:40,598 --> 01:02:44,942
is that although a particular set of memories

869
01:02:45,006 --> 01:02:48,190
vanishes, death is not the end

870
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:51,490
of consciousness. In other words,

871
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:55,822
we are deluded by a kind of fantasy.

872
01:02:55,966 --> 01:02:59,742
If we think of death as endless

873
01:02:59,806 --> 01:03:00,610
darkness,

874
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:05,886
endless nothingness is not only

875
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:09,166
inconceivable, but it's logically absolutely

876
01:03:09,198 --> 01:03:12,702
meaningless. Because we aren't able to have any idea

877
01:03:12,766 --> 01:03:16,080
or much less sensation of nothing unless it can be

878
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,620
compared with a sensation of something.

879
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,580
These two things go together.

880
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:26,096
And therefore I think what is meant is that

881
01:03:26,248 --> 01:03:29,584
the vacuum created by the disappearance of a being, by the

882
01:03:29,592 --> 01:03:33,152
disappearance of his memory system is simply

883
01:03:33,216 --> 01:03:36,700
filled by another being.

884
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,628
Who is I. Just as you feel your eye.

885
01:03:41,724 --> 01:03:44,860
The funny thing though, about being I, about feeling

886
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:48,684
that one is sort of a center of the universe, is that you

887
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:51,852
can only experience this I sensation in the singular.

888
01:03:51,996 --> 01:03:55,420
You can't experience being two or three eyes all at the same

889
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:56,040
time.

890
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:02,060
Now then, it seems to me that this idea has

891
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,400
three very important consequences.

892
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:09,190
One is that the

893
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:13,158
disappearance of our memory in death is not

894
01:04:13,214 --> 01:04:15,290
really something to be regretted.

895
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:20,358
Of course, everybody wishes to hold

896
01:04:20,414 --> 01:04:23,926
forever to the memories and to the people and the situations

897
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:27,830
that he particularly loves. But surely

898
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:32,160
if we think this room, is that what, what we actually want?

899
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:36,452
Do we really want to have those we love,

900
01:04:36,556 --> 01:04:40,160
however greatly we love them for always and always and always and always.

901
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:45,520
Isn't it inconceivable that even in a very distant future

902
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,160
we wouldn't get tired of it.

903
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:53,028
And this, indeed, is the secret of the thing.

904
01:04:53,084 --> 01:04:56,670
This is why the demon of impermanence is beneath.

905
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:01,568
Because it is forgetting about things that renews their

906
01:05:01,624 --> 01:05:05,600
wonder. Just think when you opened your eyes on

907
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,300
the world for the first time as a child.

908
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:13,980
How brilliant colors were, what a jewel the sun was,

909
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:18,752
what marvels the stars. How incredibly alive

910
01:05:18,816 --> 01:05:23,060
the trees were. That's all because they were new to your eyes.

911
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:26,994
Or in the same way you know how it is. You've been reading a mystery

912
01:05:27,042 --> 01:05:30,370
story, and you're looking around the house. You want something

913
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:33,730
to read. You pick up an old mystery store. If you read it

914
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:37,666
years and years ago. And you've forgotten all about the plot, it still excites you.

915
01:05:37,738 --> 01:05:40,590
But if you remember the plot, it doesn't excite you.

916
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:44,470
And so, by the dispensation of forgetting,

917
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:48,070
the world is constantly renewed.

918
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:51,480
And we are able to see it again and again.

919
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:55,980
And to love again and again. To have people to whom we

920
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:59,680
are deeply attached and deeply fond.

921
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:03,660
Always with renewed intensity. And without

922
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:07,148
the contrast of having seen them

923
01:06:07,284 --> 01:06:11,084
before. Before, before, before. For always and always and always.

924
01:06:11,252 --> 01:06:14,610
Another consequence of this is

925
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:17,530
a very curious realization.

926
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:23,030
Remember that question. Who would I be if

927
01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:25,050
my mother had married someone else?

928
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:30,406
Who, if I were you? We often

929
01:06:30,478 --> 01:06:33,970
said one might so easily have been you.

930
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:38,102
I might so easily have been born in China and India. Why do

931
01:06:38,126 --> 01:06:40,530
I feel that the world is centered in this place,

932
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:44,422
Distinct from some other place? You jolly well know the world is centered where you

933
01:06:44,446 --> 01:06:49,334
are. And this

934
01:06:49,502 --> 01:06:53,142
gives one a very strange feeling of

935
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:57,062
the idea that other people jolly well exist in the same sense you

936
01:06:57,086 --> 01:06:59,974
do. Everybody's name is I.

937
01:07:00,142 --> 01:07:01,770
That's what you call yourself.

938
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:07,110
So there will always be eyes in the world.

939
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:12,490
Every eye is, in a way, the same eye we

940
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:15,882
all might be anyone else. And there is

941
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:19,066
no escape. It goes on and on, on,

942
01:07:19,138 --> 01:07:22,890
on. So long as there is consciousness anywhere, that is

943
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:27,470
I. You then, in a way look out through all eyes.

944
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:31,466
And that, perhaps, is the secret of the great virtue

945
01:07:31,498 --> 01:07:32,090
of compassion.
