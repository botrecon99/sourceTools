1
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,328
I wonder, I wonder what you would do if

2
00:00:18,384 --> 00:00:21,592
you had the power to dream at night. Any dream you

3
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:22,620
wanted to dream.

4
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,750
And you would of course be able to alter your time sense

5
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,802
and slip, say, 75 years of subjective

6
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:37,590
time into eight hours of sleep.

7
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:45,746
You would, I suppose, start out by fulfilling

8
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:47,030
all your wishes.

9
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,658
You could design for yourself what would be the most

10
00:00:52,714 --> 00:00:57,326
ecstatic life. Love affairs,

11
00:00:57,518 --> 00:01:00,210
banquets, dancing girls,

12
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,450
wonderful journeys,

13
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,370
gardens, music beyond belief.

14
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,710
And then after a couple of months of this

15
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,010
sort of thing, at 75 years a night,

16
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,290
you'll be getting a little taste for something different.

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,660
And you would move over to an adventurous dimension

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,580
where there were certain dangers involved and the thrill of dealing with dangers.

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,720
And you could rescue princesses from dragons and

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,660
go on dangerous journeys,

21
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,380
make wonderful explosions and blow them up,

22
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,750
eventually get into contest with enemies.

23
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,510
And after you've done that for some time,

24
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,442
you'll think up a new wrinkle to forget that you

25
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:03,914
were dreaming so that you would think it was

26
00:02:03,922 --> 00:02:07,754
all for real and to be

27
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:09,270
anxious about it.

28
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,670
And then because be so great when you woke up.

29
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,610
And then you say, well, like children

30
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,110
who dare each other on things, how far out could you get?

31
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,110
What could you take? What dimension of being lost,

32
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,642
of abandonment, of your power? What dimension of that

33
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:38,114
could you stand? You could ask yourself this, because you know you'd eventually

34
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:42,160
wake up and

35
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,968
then you would get more and more adventurous and you would make further

36
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:48,688
and further out gambles as to what you would dream.

37
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:52,432
And finally you would dream where

38
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:53,420
you are now.

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,420
You would dream the dream of living the life that you are actually living today.

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,160
That would be within the infinite multiplicity of

41
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,884
choices you would have of playing that you weren't

42
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:12,172
God. Because the whole nature

43
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:15,772
of the Godhead, according to this idea, is to play that

44
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:19,740
he's not. So in this

45
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,360
idea then everybody is fundamentally the

46
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,092
ultimate reality. Not God in a

47
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:31,484
politically kingly sense, but God in the sense

48
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:35,146
of being the self, the deep down, basic whatever

49
00:03:35,178 --> 00:03:38,390
there is. And you're all that,

50
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,630
only you're pretending you're not.

51
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,870
One day you're going to wake up and say,

52
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,108
why, that's me. What you

53
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:07,580
are, basic, deep,

54
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,960
deep down, far far in,

55
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,884
is simply the fabric and structure

56
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:19,532
of existence itself. And when you

57
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:26,370
find that out, you laugh yourself silly.

58
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,252
Some people will use a symbolism of the

59
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:27,564
relationship of God to the universe, wherein God

60
00:05:27,612 --> 00:05:29,240
is a brilliant light,

61
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,100
only somehow veiled, hiding underneath all these

62
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,320
forms that you see as you look around you.

63
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,800
So far, so good. But the truth is funnier than that.

64
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,454
It is that you are looking right at the brilliant

65
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:48,830
light. Now that

66
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,742
the experience you are having, which you call ordinary,

67
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:55,050
everyday consciousness, pretending you're not it.

68
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,450
That experience is exactly the same thing as it.

69
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,450
There's no difference at all.

70
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,970
And when you find that out, you laugh yourself silly.

71
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,690
That's the great discovery.

72
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,170
In other words, when you really start to see things.

73
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,450
And you look at an old paper cup.

74
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,330
And you go into the nature of what it is to see.

75
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,670
What vision is or what smell is or what touches

76
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,710
you realize that that vision of the paper cup is

77
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,220
the brilliant light the cosmos.

78
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,768
Nothing could be brighter. 10,000 suns couldn't

79
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:49,960
be brighter. Only they

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,336
are hidden in the sense that all the points of the infinite

81
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:56,100
light are so tiny when you see them in the cup.

82
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,352
They don't blow your eyes out. But it

83
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:04,620
is actually, see, the source of all light is in the eye.

84
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,240
If there were no eyes in this world, the sun would not be light.

85
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,708
You evoke light out of the universe.

86
00:07:15,884 --> 00:07:19,260
In the same way you, by virtue of having a soft skin,

87
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,052
evoke hardness out of wood. Wood is

88
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:27,276
only hard in relation to a soft skin. It's your eardrum

89
00:07:27,308 --> 00:07:29,240
that evokes noise out of the air.

90
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,370
You, by being this organism, call into

91
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,762
being the whole universe of light and color and hardness and

92
00:07:38,786 --> 00:07:40,710
heaviness and everything, See?

93
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,390
Well, now here's the problem.

94
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,990
If this is the state of affairs which is so.

95
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,290
And if the consciousness state you are in

96
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,510
at this moment. Is the same thing as what we might call the

97
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,998
divine state. If you do anything to make it different,

98
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:05,454
it shows you don't understand that it's so. So the

99
00:08:05,462 --> 00:08:09,694
moment you start practicing yoga or praying or meditating

100
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,930
or indulging in some sort of spiritual cultivation,

101
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,210
you are getting in your own way.

102
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,472
If you think you have a problem, you see that you're an

103
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:26,328
ego and that you're in difficulty. The answer that the Zen master

104
00:08:26,344 --> 00:08:29,752
makes to you is, show me your ego. I want to see this thing that

105
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:33,112
has a problem. See, because when you look

106
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:37,064
for your own mind. That is to say, your own particularized

107
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:40,472
center of being. Which is separate from everything else, you won't be able

108
00:08:40,496 --> 00:08:43,832
to find it. The only way you'll know it isn't there is if you look

109
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,300
for it hard enough to find out that it isn't there.

110
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,658
So everybody says, all right, know yourself. Look within.

111
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:54,018
Find out who you are. Because the harder you look, you won't

112
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,026
be able to find it. And then you'll realize that it isn't there at all.

113
00:08:57,178 --> 00:08:58,910
There isn't a separate you.

114
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,590
Your mind is what there Is everything.

115
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,720
The reason why certain people turn to philosophy,

116
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,800
why I became a philosopher, was that since I was a little boy,

117
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,750
I always felt that existence

118
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,890
as such was weird.

119
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,422
I mean, here we are. Isn't that

120
00:09:50,446 --> 00:09:54,470
odd? Of course

121
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,650
it's odd. What do you mean? What do you mean by odd?

122
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,850
Well, it's what's different from even.

123
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,050
I mean, what's art stands out.

124
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,796
What's even lies flat. But you can't see

125
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:13,600
the outstanding without the flat background.

126
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,220
Here's the thing standing out that's odd.

127
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,980
Each one of you is odd, strange,

128
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,200
unique, particular, different.

129
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,468
How do we know what we mean by that, except against the background of something

130
00:10:31,524 --> 00:10:35,890
even that is not differentiated like space?

131
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,590
And so you get this philosophical itch.

132
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,730
You begin to scratch your head and think about, why is that so?

133
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,190
Well, after a while, you realize that's a meaningless question. And you

134
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,126
ask, how is it so? Well, that leads you into science

135
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:56,454
and other investigations. So you want to

136
00:10:56,462 --> 00:10:59,526
know what is it? I mean, this. This happening,

137
00:10:59,638 --> 00:11:02,530
this thing called existence. What is it?

138
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,502
You ask that question long enough, and it suddenly hits you that if you

139
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:10,290
could answer it, you wouldn't know what terms to put the answer in.

140
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,370
Give me some of the love. Give me some of that.

141
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:29,010
Give me some of that love. Give me some of it.

142
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,620
Sa.

143
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,402
Change. And everything is changed. Nothing could

144
00:12:35,426 --> 00:12:39,470
be held onto. To the degree that you go with a stream,

145
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,866
you see, you are still. You're flowing

146
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:47,316
with it. But to the degree you resist the stream.

147
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:51,240
Then you notice that the current is rushing past you and fighting.

148
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,360
So swim with it, go with it.

149
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,800
And you're there, you're at rest.

150
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,756
And this is, of course, particularly true when it comes to

151
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:08,052
those moments when life really seems to be going to

152
00:13:08,076 --> 00:13:11,572
take us away. And the stream of change is

153
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:14,070
going to swallow us completely. The moment of death.

154
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,470
And we think, oh, this is it.

155
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,350
This is the end.

156
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,682
And so at death, we withdraw. Say, no, no, no,

157
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:31,110
no, not that. Not. Not yet, please.

158
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,960
But actually,

159
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,620
the whole problem is

160
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,636
that it really is no other problem for human beings than

161
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:56,092
to go

162
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:58,200
over that waterfall when it comes.

163
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,452
Just as you go over any other waterfall. Just as you

164
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:06,662
go on from day to day, just as you go to

165
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:10,086
sleep at night, be absolutely

166
00:14:10,118 --> 00:14:14,678
willing to die. Now, I'm not preaching.

167
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,290
I'm not saying you ought to be willing to die. And that you should

168
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,222
muscle up your courage and somehow put on

169
00:14:23,246 --> 00:14:26,902
a good front when the terrible thing comes. That's not the idea at

170
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:31,050
all. Point is that you can only die.

171
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,060
Well, if you understand this

172
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,280
system of waves,

173
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,196
if you Understand that

174
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:46,700
your disappearance as the form in which you

175
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,460
think you are you, your disappearance as this

176
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,700
particular organism is

177
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,690
simply seasonal.

178
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:07,670
That you are just as much the

179
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:12,646
dark space beyond death as

180
00:15:12,718 --> 00:15:16,246
you are the lightened called

181
00:15:16,318 --> 00:15:20,022
life. These are

182
00:15:20,046 --> 00:15:23,664
just two sides of you because

183
00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:27,648
you is the total wave.

184
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:29,860
See, you can't have half a wave.

185
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,100
Nobody ever saw waves which just had crests,

186
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,900
no troughs.

187
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,464
So you can't have half a human being who

188
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:48,064
is born but doesn't die. Half a thing.

189
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:49,820
That would be only half a thing.

190
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,524
But the propagation of vibrations, of life is vibration.

191
00:15:56,652 --> 00:16:00,380
It simply goes on and on. But its cycles are long cycles and

192
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,520
short cycles.

193
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,156
Space, you see,

194
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:10,560
is not just nothing.

195
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,804
If I could magnify my hand to an enormous

196
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:20,140
degree so that you could see all the molecules in it,

197
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,832
I don't know how far apart they would be, but it seems to me

198
00:16:24,856 --> 00:16:28,528
they would be something like tennis balls in a very,

199
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:29,900
very large space.

200
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,380
And you'd look, when I move my hand like this,

201
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,380
you say, for God's sake, look at all those tennis balls. They're all going together

202
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,060
crazy. And there are no strings tying them together.

203
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,256
That queer. No, but there's space.

204
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:53,064
Going with space is a function

205
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:57,000
of, or it's an inseparable aspect of whatever solids are

206
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,860
in space.

207
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,500
That is the clue, probably to what we mean by gravity.

208
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,114
We don't know. So in

209
00:17:10,122 --> 00:17:13,330
the same way, when those marvelous sandpipers come around here,

210
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,882
the little ones, while they're in the air flying,

211
00:17:16,946 --> 00:17:20,030
they have one mind. They move all together.

212
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,514
When they alight on the mud, they become individuals and they go pecking around for

213
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:27,906
worms. One click of the fingers and

214
00:17:27,978 --> 00:17:31,282
all those things are zipped into the air. They don't seem to have a

215
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:34,162
leader because they don't follow. When they turn,

216
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:37,620
they all turn together and go off in another direction.

217
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,940
Amazing. But they're like the molecules in my hand.

218
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,180
So then you see, here's the principle.

219
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,700
When you don't resist change,

220
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,020
I mean over resist, I don't mean being flabby.

221
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,160
When you don't resist change, you see that the changing

222
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,426
world which disappears like smoke,

223
00:18:04,538 --> 00:18:06,950
is no different from the Nirvana world.

224
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,990
Nirvana, as I said, means breathe out,

225
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,714
let go of the breath. So in the same way, don't resist

226
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,750
change. It's all the same principle.

227
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,510
So the Bodhisattva saves all beings.

228
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,350
Not by preaching sermons to them,

229
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:33,234
but by showing them that they are delivered.

230
00:18:33,282 --> 00:18:37,362
They are liberated by the very fact of not being able

231
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:39,030
to stop changing.

232
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,162
You can't hang on to yourself. You don't have

233
00:18:46,186 --> 00:18:49,110
to try not to hang on to yourself.

234
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,030
It can't be done. And that is salvation.

235
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,440
Memento mori. Be mindful of death.

236
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:05,132
Gurdjieff says in one of his books that

237
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:08,748
the most important thing for anyone to realize is

238
00:19:08,804 --> 00:19:11,836
that you and all you,

239
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:15,840
every person you see, will soon be dead.

240
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:23,970
It sounds so gloomy to us because

241
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:28,470
we have devised the culture fundamentally

242
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,730
resisting death.

243
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,022
From the first standpoint, the worst is going to happen.

244
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:37,610
You're all going to die.

245
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,854
And don't just put it off in the back of your mind and say,

246
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:44,690
I'll consider that later.

247
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,188
It's the most important thing to consider now because

248
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:57,988
it enables you, it is the mercy of nature because

249
00:19:58,044 --> 00:20:01,796
it's going to enable you to let go and not defend

250
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:05,380
yourself all the time, waste all the energies in

251
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,360
self defense.

252
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:37,288
Sa wonder

253
00:20:37,384 --> 00:20:41,576
is, is like in modern philosophy, something you mustn't have. It's like enthusiasm

254
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:45,032
in 18th century England. But you

255
00:20:45,056 --> 00:20:48,472
see, I don't know what question to ask when I wonder about the

256
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:51,800
universe. It isn't a question that I'm wondering about.

257
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,840
It's a feeling that I have because

258
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,776
I cannot formulate the question that is my wonder. The moment

259
00:21:00,808 --> 00:21:04,220
my mouth opens to utter it, I suddenly find I'm talking nonsense.

260
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,000
But that should not prevent wonder from being the foundation of philosophy

261
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,960
going into our common sense. The 19th century myth

262
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,372
which succeeded the ceramic myth in Western history. I call

263
00:21:20,396 --> 00:21:22,680
it the myth of the fully automatic model.

264
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,812
Man is a little germ that lives on an unimportant rock

265
00:21:27,876 --> 00:21:31,416
ball that revolves about an insignificant star

266
00:21:31,548 --> 00:21:34,260
on the outer edges of one of the smaller galaxies.

267
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,976
But on the other hand, if you think about that for a few minutes,

268
00:21:39,168 --> 00:21:42,784
I am absolutely amazed to discover myself on this rock

269
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:46,540
ball rotating around a spherical fire.

270
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,472
It's a very odd situation. And the more I look

271
00:21:51,496 --> 00:21:54,736
at things, I cannot get rid

272
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:58,430
of the feeling that existence is. Is quite weird.

273
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,898
There is obviously a place in life

274
00:22:03,954 --> 00:22:08,282
for a religious attitude in the sense of awe,

275
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:11,070
astonishment at existence.

276
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,226
And that is also a basis

277
00:22:17,258 --> 00:22:21,070
of respect for existence.

278
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,040
It has become extremely plausible that

279
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,044
this trip between the maternity ward and

280
00:22:35,052 --> 00:22:38,640
the crematorium is what there is to life.

281
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,388
Here is a tree in the garden, and every

282
00:22:48,444 --> 00:22:50,280
summer it produces apples.

283
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,162
And we call it an apple tree because the

284
00:22:55,186 --> 00:22:58,950
tree apples, that's what it does.

285
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,258
All right. Now, here is a solar system

286
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:09,194
inside a galaxy. And one of the peculiarities

287
00:23:09,242 --> 00:23:13,310
of this solar system is that at least on the planet Earth, the thing peoples

288
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,030
in just the same way that an apple tree apples.

289
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:24,510
Now, maybe 2 million years ago,

290
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,418
somebody came from another galaxy in a flying saucer and

291
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:31,554
had a look at this solar system, and they looked it

292
00:23:31,562 --> 00:23:34,530
over and shrugged their shoulders and said, just a bunch of rocks,

293
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,550
and they went away. Later on,

294
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,466
maybe 2 million years later, they came around and they looked

295
00:23:42,498 --> 00:23:45,144
at it again and they said, excuse me,

296
00:23:45,312 --> 00:23:49,912
we thought it was a bunch of rocks, but it's peopling and

297
00:23:49,936 --> 00:23:53,100
it's alive. After all, it has done something intelligent.

298
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,760
Because, you see, we grow out of this world in

299
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,456
exactly the same way that the apples grow on the apple tree.

300
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:05,540
If evolution means anything, it means that.

301
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,410
But you see, we. We curiously twist it.

302
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,654
We say, well, first of all, in the beginning there was nothing but gas

303
00:24:15,702 --> 00:24:19,210
and rock. And then intelligence

304
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,990
happened to arise in it, you know, like a sort of

305
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,850
fungus or slime on the top of the whole thing.

306
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:32,730
But we are thinking in a way, you see, that disconnects the intelligence

307
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:37,540
from the rocks. Where there are rocks,

308
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,344
watch out, watch out,

309
00:24:41,512 --> 00:24:44,660
because the rocks are going eventually to come alive.

310
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,504
I believe that there is a strong distinction between

311
00:24:57,592 --> 00:25:00,940
faith on the one hand and belief on the other.

312
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,960
That belief is, as a matter of fact, quite contrary

313
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,720
to faith, because belief is really

314
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,432
wishing. It's from the Anglo Saxon root leaf to wish.

315
00:25:14,576 --> 00:25:17,700
And belief, stated, say, in the creed,

316
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,336
is a fervent hope that the universe

317
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:24,780
will turn out to be thus and so.

318
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,152
And in this sense, therefore, belief precludes the possibility

319
00:25:29,216 --> 00:25:32,828
of faith, because faith is openness to

320
00:25:32,884 --> 00:25:36,188
truth, to reality, whatever it may turn out to be.

321
00:25:36,324 --> 00:25:39,760
I want to know the truth. That is the attitude of faith.

322
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,412
And therefore, to use ideas about the

323
00:25:44,436 --> 00:25:48,044
universe and about God as something to hang

324
00:25:48,092 --> 00:25:51,916
on to in the spirit of Rock

325
00:25:51,948 --> 00:25:55,212
of Ages Cleft for me and

326
00:25:55,236 --> 00:25:59,102
there's something very rigid about a rock, and we are finding

327
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:02,862
our rock getting rather worn out in an

328
00:26:02,886 --> 00:26:06,942
age where it becomes more and more obvious that our world is a floating

329
00:26:07,006 --> 00:26:12,526
world. It's a world floating in space where

330
00:26:12,598 --> 00:26:16,610
all positions are relative and any point may be regarded as the center.

331
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,846
A world which doesn't float on anything. And therefore, the religious

332
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:24,600
attitude appropriate to our time is not one of clinging to rocks,

333
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,988
but of learning to swim. And you know

334
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,900
that if you get in the water and you have nothing to hold on to,

335
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,360
and you try to behave as you would on dry land, you will drown.

336
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,188
But if, on the other hand, you trust yourself to the water and let

337
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:42,740
go, you will float. And this is

338
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,760
exactly the situation of faith.

339
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,908
Imagine the idea that the moment you were born,

340
00:26:50,004 --> 00:26:53,602
you were kicked off the edge of a precipice and

341
00:26:53,626 --> 00:26:56,754
you are falling as you fell.

342
00:26:56,802 --> 00:27:00,386
A great lump of rock came with you, and it's traveling

343
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:03,986
alongside you, and you're clinging to it for dear

344
00:27:04,018 --> 00:27:07,314
life and thinking,

345
00:27:07,362 --> 00:27:10,962
gee, I gotta hold on to this. See? Well, it doesn't do a

346
00:27:10,986 --> 00:27:14,434
thing for you, and you'll only.

347
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:18,272
It's only making you anxious, and it's only when you understand

348
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:21,800
that it doesn't do a thing for you that you let go and relax.

349
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,676
So everybody's in this situation. We're all completely insecure.

350
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:32,436
We are all headed straight for death as if we had been condemned

351
00:27:32,468 --> 00:27:35,908
by a judge. And yet here we are all clinging

352
00:27:35,924 --> 00:27:39,732
on to things, and we. We have all sorts of alibis for doing

353
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:42,964
this. We say, well, I have responsibilities for my dependence,

354
00:27:43,012 --> 00:27:45,946
and I've got to cling on. But all you're doing is you're teaching your dependents

355
00:27:45,978 --> 00:27:49,130
to cling the same way as you are and making

356
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,270
them miserable by learning

357
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,150
to go on surviving compulsively.

358
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:59,550
So the thing is, same way, if you're caught in a torrent

359
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:04,106
and you try to get out of it by swimming against it, you'll just wear

360
00:28:04,138 --> 00:28:08,026
yourself out and you're still carried along with it. So the sensible thing to do

361
00:28:08,098 --> 00:28:11,440
is to turn around, swim with it,

362
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,120
and if you want to get out of it, swim towards the edge,

363
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,932
but go with it. Same way when you're sailing, always keep the

364
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:28,120
wind in your sails. If you want to go against the wind, tack,

365
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,292
but use the wind. So it's this way, you know,

366
00:28:32,316 --> 00:28:36,190
we're all in this great stream of change which we call life.

367
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,242
We are the stream. If you imagine you

368
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:45,202
are separate from it and you're being carried along by it as if you were

369
00:28:45,226 --> 00:28:49,430
a cork, that's a delusion. You're a wave of the stream itself.

370
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,390
So get with it.

371
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:36,810
This seminar called Inevitable Ecstasy is

372
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,550
about a very sticky problem,

373
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,554
which is to say the problem to which the Buddha primarily

374
00:30:44,602 --> 00:30:47,970
addressed himself, which is that of

375
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,230
agony, suffering.

376
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,230
But before we get into that,

377
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,390
we have to be clear about certain basics.

378
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:06,258
And these basics have to do not so much with concepts and

379
00:31:06,314 --> 00:31:10,082
ideas as they do with the state

380
00:31:10,106 --> 00:31:13,370
of mind, a state of sensation,

381
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,530
a state of consciousness.

382
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,958
And we need to

383
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:25,542
understand that, even be in that, before we can really

384
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:26,690
go very far.

385
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,422
And this is an extraordinarily difficult state of mind to

386
00:31:32,446 --> 00:31:35,606
talk about, even though in its nature it's extremely

387
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:40,350
simple, because it

388
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:44,290
is, in a way, like we were when we were babies,

389
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:48,222
when we hadn't been told anything and didn't know anything other than

390
00:31:48,246 --> 00:31:50,970
what we felt and we had no names for it.

391
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:56,210
Now, of course, as we grow older,

392
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,942
we learn to differentiate one thing from

393
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:04,006
another, one event from another, and above all,

394
00:32:04,158 --> 00:32:09,430
ourselves from everything else well

395
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,886
and good, provided you don't

396
00:32:12,918 --> 00:32:16,902
lose the foundations. Just as mountains

397
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:20,170
are differentiated, but they're all based on the earth,

398
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:24,810
so the multiple things of this world are differentiated,

399
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:29,930
but they have, as it were, a basis.

400
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,870
There is no word for that basis, not really,

401
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,750
because words are only for distinction.

402
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,310
And so there can't really be a word, not even an idea

403
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:47,610
of the non distinction. We can

404
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:51,242
feel it, but we can't think it, but we

405
00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:55,230
don't feel it like an object. You feel you're alive,

406
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,108
you feel you're conscious, but you don't know what consciousness is,

407
00:32:59,164 --> 00:33:02,500
because consciousness is present in every conceivable kind

408
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:06,724
of experience. It's like the space

409
00:33:06,812 --> 00:33:10,200
in which we live, which is everywhere.

410
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,924
It's like a fish being in water. And presumably

411
00:33:13,972 --> 00:33:17,280
a fish doesn't know it's in the water because it never goes out.

412
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,920
A bird, presumably, knows nothing of the air,

413
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,590
and we really know nothing of consciousness,

414
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,970
and we pretend space isn't there.

415
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,530
So however,

416
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:38,774
when you grow up and become

417
00:33:38,942 --> 00:33:41,974
fascinated, which is really the right word, spellbound,

418
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:45,222
enchanted by all the things that adults wave at

419
00:33:45,246 --> 00:33:50,372
you, you forget the background and

420
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:56,660
you come to think that all the distinctions which you've been learning are

421
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,080
the supremely important things to be concerned with.

422
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,860
You become hypnotized. And so when we

423
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,252
are told to pay attention to what matters, we get stuck with it.

424
00:34:09,276 --> 00:34:12,040
And that's what in Buddhism is called attachment.

425
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:19,630
Attachment doesn't mean that

426
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,090
you enjoy your dinner,

427
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:27,330
you enjoy sleeping or beauty.

428
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:32,910
Those are responses of our organism

429
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:36,030
in its environment as natural as feeling hot near

430
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,050
a fire or cold near ice.

431
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,340
So are certain responses of fear or of sorrow.

432
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,912
They are not attachment. Attachment is exactly

433
00:34:49,976 --> 00:34:53,140
translated by the modern slang term hang up.

434
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,872
It's a kind of stickiness, or what in psychology would

435
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:02,632
be called blocking, when you are in a

436
00:35:02,656 --> 00:35:06,136
state of wobbly hesitation, not knowing how to flow

437
00:35:06,168 --> 00:35:09,844
on. That's attachment. What is meant by the Sanskrit

438
00:35:09,892 --> 00:35:11,240
word klesha.

439
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,196
So we get a hang up on all the various things that we're

440
00:35:18,228 --> 00:35:21,204
told as we grow up by our parents,

441
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:25,120
our aunts and uncles, our teachers, by our peer group.

442
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,560
And the first thing that everybody wants to tell us

443
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:35,334
is the difference between ourselves and

444
00:35:35,422 --> 00:35:38,854
the rest of the world and between those actions

445
00:35:38,902 --> 00:35:43,370
which are voluntary and those which are involuntary,

446
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,046
what we do on the one hand and what happens

447
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:50,582
to us on the other. And this is of

448
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:54,358
course immensely confusing to a small child because

449
00:35:54,414 --> 00:35:57,890
it's told to do all sorts of things that are really supposed to happen.

450
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,980
Like going to sleep, like having bowel movements,

451
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,580
like loving people,

452
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,500
like not blushing, stopping being anxious,

453
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,860
and all sorts of things like that.

454
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,840
So what happens is this. The child is

455
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,008
told, in sum, that we,

456
00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:26,082
your parents, elders and betters, command you to

457
00:36:26,106 --> 00:36:29,590
do what will please us only if you do it spontaneously.

458
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,990
And no wonder everybody's completely confused.

459
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,550
We go through life with that burden on us.

460
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:45,150
We therefore develop this curious thing.

461
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,990
We develop a thing which is called an ego.

462
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,870
Now, I've got to be very clear to you what I mean by an ego.

463
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,316
An ego is not the same thing as a

464
00:36:58,388 --> 00:37:00,320
particular living organism.

465
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,980
For my philosophy, the particular living organism which

466
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,756
is inseparable from a particular environment,

467
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:13,320
that is to say from the universe as centered here and now.

468
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,772
There's something real. It isn't a thing, I call

469
00:37:17,796 --> 00:37:19,600
it a feature of the universe.

470
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:27,070
But what we call our ego is

471
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,370
something abstract,

472
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,930
which is to say it has the same order and kind of reality

473
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:39,966
as an hour or an inch

474
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:43,490
or a pound or a line of longitude.

475
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,800
It is for purposes of discussion, it is for convenience.

476
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,240
In other words, it is a social convention that we

477
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,180
have what is called an ego. But the fallacy

478
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,352
that all of us make is that we treat it as if it were a

479
00:38:01,376 --> 00:38:05,208
physical organ. As if it were

480
00:38:05,264 --> 00:38:08,600
real in that sense. When in fact

481
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,220
it is composed on the one hand of our

482
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,520
image of ourselves.

483
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,340
That is our idea of ourselves. As when we say

484
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,760
to somebody, you must improve your image.

485
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,280
Now, this image of ourselves is obviously not ourselves

486
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,092
any more than an idea of a tree is a

487
00:38:32,116 --> 00:38:35,660
tree. Any more than

488
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,120
you can get wet in the word water or.

489
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,366
And to go on with our image of ourselves is extremely inaccurate

490
00:38:45,398 --> 00:38:49,302
and incomplete. Would that some God the gifted gears

491
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:53,050
to see ourselves as others see us. We don't.

492
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,302
So my image of me is not at all your image of me.

493
00:38:57,486 --> 00:39:00,742
And my image of me is extremely incomplete in that it

494
00:39:00,766 --> 00:39:04,050
does not include any information

495
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,982
to speak of about the functioning of my nervous system,

496
00:39:08,086 --> 00:39:12,638
my circulation, my metabolism, my subtle relationships

497
00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:16,290
with the entire surrounding human and non human universe.

498
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,290
So the image I have of myself is a caricature.

499
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:26,430
It is arrived at through

500
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:29,902
mainly my interaction with other people who tell me

501
00:39:29,926 --> 00:39:33,972
who I am in various ways, either directly or indirectly.

502
00:39:34,116 --> 00:39:37,556
And I play about with what their picture

503
00:39:37,588 --> 00:39:41,012
is of me. And they play something back to me.

504
00:39:41,036 --> 00:39:44,804
So that we set up this conception. And this started

505
00:39:44,892 --> 00:39:46,560
very, very early in life.

506
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,440
And I was told, you see, and you were told

507
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,480
that we must have a consistent Image,

508
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,918
you must be you. You have to find your identity.

509
00:40:00,094 --> 00:40:04,370
In terms of image, this is an awful red herring.

510
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,734
A lot of the current quest for identity among younger

511
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:12,462
people is a search for an

512
00:40:12,486 --> 00:40:15,710
acceptable image. What role can

513
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,262
I play? Who am I in the sense of what am I going to do

514
00:40:19,286 --> 00:40:23,570
in life? And so on. Now, while that has a certain importance,

515
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:29,270
if it's not backed up by deeper matters, it's extraordinarily misleading.

516
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:35,394
So therefore, on the one hand, there is this image which is intellectual,

517
00:40:35,522 --> 00:40:39,730
emotional, imaginative and

518
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,618
so forth. Now, we would

519
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:47,122
say, I don't feel that I

520
00:40:47,226 --> 00:40:50,480
am only an image.

521
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:57,388
I feel there's something more real than that. Because I

522
00:40:57,444 --> 00:41:02,460
feel. I mean, I have a sense of there being a

523
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,200
particular sort of.

524
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,164
How do we say, a center of something,

525
00:41:11,332 --> 00:41:14,684
some sort of sensitive core inside

526
00:41:14,732 --> 00:41:18,048
the skin. And that

527
00:41:18,104 --> 00:41:20,700
corresponds to the word I.

528
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,380
Let's take a look at this.

529
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,860
Because the thing that we feel as being myself

530
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,540
is certainly not the whole body,

531
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,952
because a lot of the body can be seen as

532
00:41:41,976 --> 00:41:45,470
an object. In other words, if you

533
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:49,102
stand, stretch yourself out, lie on the floor and turn your head and look

534
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:53,150
at yourself, you know, you can see your feet and your legs and

535
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:56,622
all this up to here, and finally it all vanishes. Only there's a sort of

536
00:41:56,646 --> 00:41:58,090
a vague nose in front.

537
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,518
And you assume you have a head because everybody else does, and you've

538
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:07,022
looked in a mirror and that told you you had a head, but you could

539
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:09,610
never see it, just like you can't see your back.

540
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,240
So you tend to put your ego on the side of the

541
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,920
unseen part of the body, the part

542
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,552
you can't get at, because that seems to be where it all comes from.

543
00:42:22,576 --> 00:42:23,700
And you feel it.

544
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,816
But what is it that we feel? Because if I see clearly

545
00:42:29,928 --> 00:42:33,832
and my eyes are in functioning order, the eyes certainly

546
00:42:33,976 --> 00:42:37,346
are not conscious of themselves, themselves. There are no spots

547
00:42:37,378 --> 00:42:40,482
in front of them, no defects, in other words, in the lens or in the

548
00:42:40,506 --> 00:42:44,470
retina or in the optic nerves that give hallucinations.

549
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,746
So also, therefore, if my ego, my consciousness is working properly,

550
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:55,298
I ought not to be aware of it as something sort

551
00:42:55,314 --> 00:42:58,882
of there being a nuisance, in a way,

552
00:42:58,906 --> 00:43:02,240
in the middle of things. Because your ego is awfully hard to take care of.

553
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,692
Well, what is it then that we feel? Well, I think I've discovered what it

554
00:43:06,716 --> 00:43:07,280
is.

555
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:16,692
It's a chronic habitual sense of muscular strain which

556
00:43:16,716 --> 00:43:20,644
we were taught in the whole process of doing spontaneous

557
00:43:20,692 --> 00:43:21,680
things to order.

558
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:30,262
When you're taking off in a jet plane and

559
00:43:30,286 --> 00:43:33,190
the thing has gone rather further down the Runway than you think it should have

560
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:37,126
without getting up in the air, you start pulling

561
00:43:37,158 --> 00:43:40,662
at your seat belt, get this thing off the

562
00:43:40,686 --> 00:43:42,810
ground. Perfectly useless.

563
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:49,190
So in the same way, when our community

564
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:53,370
tells us, look carefully,

565
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:58,266
now, listen, pay attention, we start

566
00:43:58,338 --> 00:44:02,190
using muscular strains around our eyes, ears,

567
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:05,070
jaws, hands,

568
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,990
to try to use our muscles to make our nerves work,

569
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:12,830
which is of course futile.

570
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:18,510
And in fact, it gets in the way of the functioning of the nerves.

571
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,360
Try to concentrate.

572
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,920
And then when we try to control our emotions,

573
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,916
we hold our breath, pull our stomachs in, or tighten

574
00:44:28,948 --> 00:44:32,340
our rectal muscles to hold

575
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,716
ourselves together. Now pull yourself together immediately.

576
00:44:35,748 --> 00:44:38,932
What are you to do? What does a child understand by that? He does

577
00:44:38,956 --> 00:44:42,600
it muscularly, pulls himself together. It's just useless.

578
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:48,462
So everybody chronically pulls themselves together so

579
00:44:48,486 --> 00:44:51,534
that. It's so funny. If you get a person to just lie on the floor

580
00:44:51,582 --> 00:44:54,942
and relax, there's the floor under you as firm as can be

581
00:44:54,966 --> 00:44:58,158
holding you up. Nevertheless, you will detect that the person is making

582
00:44:58,214 --> 00:45:01,970
all sorts of tensions lest he should suddenly

583
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:10,140
turn into a nasty jello on the floor.

584
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:14,008
So that chronic tension, which in Sanskrit is called samkocha,

585
00:45:14,104 --> 00:45:17,672
which means contraction, is the root of

586
00:45:17,696 --> 00:45:21,384
what we call the feeling of the ego. So that, in other words,

587
00:45:21,432 --> 00:45:25,400
this feeling of tightness is the physical

588
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,560
referent for the psychological image

589
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,272
of ourselves. So that we get the ego as

590
00:45:33,296 --> 00:45:35,500
the marriage of an illusion to a futility.

591
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:40,674
Even though the idea of an I with a name,

592
00:45:40,762 --> 00:45:44,786
with a being is naturally useful for social

593
00:45:44,858 --> 00:45:49,010
communication, provided we know what we're doing and

594
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:51,070
take it for what it is.

595
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:58,630
But we are so hung up on this concept

596
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:11,612
that it confuses us even in

597
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:15,360
the proposition that it might be possible for us to feel otherwise.

598
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:22,600
Because we ask the question, if we hear about people who have

599
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:26,412
transcended the ego, well, we ask, how do

600
00:46:26,436 --> 00:46:29,640
you do that? Well, I say,

601
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:34,040
what do you mean, you? How do you do that?

602
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,320
Because the you you're talking about doesn't exist,

603
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,300
so you can't do anything about it any

604
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,600
more than you can cut a cheese with a line of longitude.

605
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,400
Now, that sounds very discouraging, doesn't it?

606
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,080
But let's suppose now you are babies again and

607
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,300
you don't know anything.

608
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,288
Now, don't be frightened, because anything you know, you can get back

609
00:47:12,344 --> 00:47:15,340
later. But for the time being,

610
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:22,778
here is our

611
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:23,630
awareness.

612
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:31,514
And let's suppose you have no information about this at all and no words

613
00:47:31,562 --> 00:47:32,310
for it,

614
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:37,790
and that my talking to you is just a noise.

615
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,012
Now, don't try to do anything about this.

616
00:47:55,196 --> 00:47:56,680
Don't make any effort,

617
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:02,180
because naturally, by force of habit.

618
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,876
Certain tensions remain inside you and certain ideas

619
00:48:05,908 --> 00:48:08,560
and words drift all the time through your mind.

620
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,820
Just like wind blows or clouds move across

621
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,320
the sky, don't bother with them at all,

622
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:21,460
don't try to get rid of them. Just be

623
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:29,172
aware of what's going on in your head like

624
00:48:29,196 --> 00:48:34,212
it was clouds in the sky or

625
00:48:34,236 --> 00:48:35,600
the crackling of the fire.

626
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,010
There's no problem to this.

627
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:50,130
All you have to do really is look and listen

628
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:54,862
without naming. And if

629
00:48:54,886 --> 00:48:58,526
you are naming, never mind, just listen

630
00:48:58,558 --> 00:48:59,290
to that.

631
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,260
Now, that you can't force anything here,

632
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,688
that you can't willfully

633
00:49:19,784 --> 00:49:22,380
stop thinking and stop naming,

634
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,632
is only telling you that

635
00:49:30,656 --> 00:49:32,620
the separate you doesn't exist.

636
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,176
It isn't a mark of defeat, it isn't

637
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:41,900
a sign of your lack of practice in meditation.

638
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,920
That it runs on all by itself simply means that the individual

639
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,500
separate you is a figment of your imagination.

640
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,110
So you are aware at this point of

641
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:59,170
a happening.

642
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:05,838
Remember, you don't know anything about the difference between

643
00:50:05,894 --> 00:50:09,450
you and it. You haven't been told that

644
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:16,970
you've no words for the difference between inside and outside,

645
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,730
between here and there.

646
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,300
And nobody has taught you that what you see out in front of you

647
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,920
is either near or

648
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,500
far from your eyes.

649
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,980
Watch a baby put out a finger to touch the moon.

650
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:52,100
You don't know about just

651
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,380
therefore here it is,

652
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,100
we'll just call it this.

653
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,220
And if you will feel it,

654
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:13,590
the going on which includes

655
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:18,030
absolutely everything you feel.

656
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:30,870
And it's a happening.

657
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:38,860
It doesn't happen to you because where is

658
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,880
that you, what you call you is part of the happening

659
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:47,484
or an aspect of it has no parts. It's not like a

660
00:51:47,492 --> 00:51:48,240
machine.

661
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:55,516
And it's a little scary because you'd

662
00:51:55,548 --> 00:51:57,560
say, well, who's in control around here?

663
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,400
Why should there be anyone?

664
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:09,382
That's a very weird notion we have that processes

665
00:52:09,446 --> 00:52:12,690
require something outside them to control them.

666
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:17,206
It never occurred to us that processes could be self controlling.

667
00:52:17,398 --> 00:52:20,742
Even though we say to someone, control yourself. We can

668
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:24,710
always, in order to think about self control, we split

669
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:28,662
a person in two so

670
00:52:28,686 --> 00:52:31,974
that there's a you separate from the self that's supposed to be controlled.

671
00:52:32,022 --> 00:52:35,542
Well, how can that achieve anything? How can

672
00:52:35,566 --> 00:52:39,974
a noun start a verb? Yet it's a fundamental superstition

673
00:52:40,022 --> 00:52:41,250
that that can be done.

674
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:47,350
So you have this process which is quite spontaneous

675
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,170
going on. We call it life. It's controlling itself.

676
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:54,662
It's aware of itself. It's aware of itself

677
00:52:54,726 --> 00:52:58,374
through you. You are an aperture through which the universe looks at

678
00:52:58,382 --> 00:53:01,808
itself. And because of its

679
00:53:01,864 --> 00:53:05,360
the universe looking at itself through you there's always an

680
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,740
aspect of itself that it can't see.

681
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,540
So it is like that snake you see that is pursuing its tail

682
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,700
because the snake can't see its head like you can't.

683
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,820
So therefore,

684
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:28,110
we always find, as we investigate the universe,

685
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:33,946
make the microscope bigger and bigger and bigger,

686
00:53:34,058 --> 00:53:37,350
and we will find ever more minute things,

687
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:41,322
make the telescope bigger and bigger and bigger, and the universe

688
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:43,790
expands because it's running away from itself.

689
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:48,230
It won't do that if you don't chase it.

690
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:57,168
An ego is not the same thing as

691
00:54:57,224 --> 00:54:59,540
a particular living organism.

692
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,960
For my philosophy, the particular living organism which

693
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,016
is inseparable from a particular environment,

694
00:55:08,168 --> 00:55:11,620
that is to say from the universe, as centered here, here and now,

695
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,980
there's something real. It isn't a thing.

696
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,180
I call it a feature of the universe.

697
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,760
But what we call our ego is

698
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,472
something abstract, which is to say it

699
00:55:30,496 --> 00:55:34,264
has the same order and kind of reality as

700
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:37,922
an hour or an inch or

701
00:55:37,946 --> 00:55:40,950
a pound or a line of longitude.

702
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:47,170
It is for purposes of discussion, it is for convenience.

703
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:51,042
In other words, it is a social convention that we have what

704
00:55:51,066 --> 00:55:52,230
is called an ego.

705
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:58,642
But the fallacy that all of us make is

706
00:55:58,666 --> 00:56:02,090
that we treat it as if it were a physical organization,

707
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,920
as if it were real in that sense,

708
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,132
when in fact it is composed on the one hand of

709
00:56:11,156 --> 00:56:14,428
our image of ourselves, that is our

710
00:56:14,484 --> 00:56:18,172
idea of ourselves. As when we say to somebody, you must

711
00:56:18,196 --> 00:56:19,520
improve your image.

712
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:24,960
Now, this image of ourselves is obviously not ourselves

713
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:30,740
anymore than an idea of a tree is a tree

714
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,780
any more than you can get wet in the word water.

715
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,144
And to go on with our image of ourselves is extremely

716
00:56:40,192 --> 00:56:44,176
inaccurate and incomplete. So my image

717
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:46,620
of me is not at all your image of me.

718
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:52,860
And my image of me is extremely incomplete in that it does not include

719
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:57,786
any information to speak of about the functioning

720
00:56:57,818 --> 00:57:01,550
of my nervous system, my circulation, my metabolism,

721
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:05,578
my subtle relationships with the entire surrounding human

722
00:57:05,634 --> 00:57:07,310
and non human universe.

723
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:12,990
So the image I have of myself as a caricature,

724
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:18,898
it is arrived at through mainly

725
00:57:19,034 --> 00:57:22,482
my interaction with other people who tell me who I am in

726
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:26,210
various ways, either directly or indirectly. And I play

727
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:30,082
about with what their picture is of me, and they play

728
00:57:30,186 --> 00:57:36,162
something back to me. So that we set up this conception and

729
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:38,510
this started very, very early in life.

730
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:44,610
And I was told, you see, and you were told that

731
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:48,690
we must have a consistent image. You must

732
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:53,346
be you. You have to find your identity

733
00:57:53,538 --> 00:57:57,830
in terms of image. This is an awful red herring.

734
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:03,426
A lot of the current quest for identity among younger people

735
00:58:03,578 --> 00:58:07,670
is a search for an acceptable image.

736
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:12,082
What role can I play who am I in the sense of

737
00:58:12,106 --> 00:58:15,942
what am I going to do in life? And so on. Now, while that has

738
00:58:15,966 --> 00:58:17,530
a certain importance,

739
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:23,770
if it's not backed up by deeper matters, it's extraordinarily misleading.

740
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:30,262
So therefore, on the one hand, there is this image which is intellectual,

741
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:34,678
emotional, imaginative and

742
00:58:34,734 --> 00:58:35,530
so forth.

743
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:41,660
Now we would say, I don't feel that

744
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:44,160
I am only an image.

745
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:50,508
I feel there's something more real than that. Because I

746
00:58:50,564 --> 00:58:56,540
feel. I mean, I have a sense of there being a

747
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:59,740
particular sort of a

748
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:03,440
center of something, some sort of sensitive core

749
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:08,120
inside the skin. And that corresponds

750
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,720
to the word I. Let's take a look

751
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,500
at this.

752
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,800
Because the thing that we feel as being myself is

753
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,620
certainly not the whole body,

754
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,140
because a lot of the body can be seen as an object.

755
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,816
In other words, if you stand, stretch yourself out,

756
00:59:29,888 --> 00:59:33,150
lie on the floor and turn your head and look at yourself, you know,

757
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:36,542
you can see your feet and your legs and all this up to

758
00:59:36,566 --> 00:59:39,854
here. And finally it all vanishes. Only there's a sort of a vague nose

759
00:59:39,902 --> 00:59:43,358
in front. And you assume

760
00:59:43,374 --> 00:59:47,170
you have a head because everybody else does, and you've looked in a mirror

761
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:50,302
and that told you you had a head, but you could never see it,

762
00:59:50,406 --> 00:59:52,170
just like you can't see your back.

763
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:57,742
So you tend to put your ego on the side of the

764
00:59:57,766 --> 01:00:01,448
unseen part of the body, the part

765
01:00:01,504 --> 01:00:05,080
you can't get at, because that seems to be where it all comes from.

766
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,728
And you feel it. But what is it that we feel?

767
01:00:08,784 --> 01:00:12,980
Because if I see clearly and my eyes are in functioning order,

768
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,140
the eyes certainly are not conscious of themselves.

769
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,992
There are no spots in front of them, no defects, in other words, in the

770
01:00:22,016 --> 01:00:26,280
lens or in the retina or in the optic nerves that give hallucinations.

771
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:31,620
So also, therefore, if my ego, my consciousness, is working

772
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:35,588
properly, I ought not to be aware of it as something sort

773
01:00:35,604 --> 01:00:38,724
of there being a nuisance,

774
01:00:38,772 --> 01:00:41,428
in a way, in the middle of things. Because your ego is awfully hard to

775
01:00:41,484 --> 01:00:45,360
take care of. Well, what is it then that we feel?

776
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,720
Well, I think I've discovered what it is.

777
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:55,990
It's a chronic habitual sense of muscular strain,

778
01:00:57,370 --> 01:01:00,642
which we were taught in the whole process of

779
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:02,670
doing spontaneous things to order.

780
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:08,882
When you're taking off in a jet plane and

781
01:01:08,906 --> 01:01:11,810
the thing has gone rather further down the Runway than you think it should have,

782
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:15,378
without getting up in the air, you start

783
01:01:15,434 --> 01:01:16,870
pulling at your seat belt,

784
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:21,370
get this thing off the ground, perfectly useless.

785
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:26,646
So in the same way, when our community tells

786
01:01:26,678 --> 01:01:29,370
us, look carefully,

787
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:34,166
now, listen, pay attention, we start

788
01:01:34,238 --> 01:01:37,830
using muscular strains around our eyes, ears,

789
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:39,450
jaws, hands,

790
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:44,290
to try to use our muscles to make our nerves work,

791
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,260
which is, of course, futile.

792
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,940
And in fact, it gets in the way of the functioning of the nerves.

793
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,860
And then when we try to control our emotions,

794
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,384
we hold our breath, pull our stomachs in or tighten our rectal

795
01:02:03,432 --> 01:02:07,032
muscles to hold ourselves together. Now,

796
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,260
pull yourself together.

797
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:15,522
What are you to do? What does a child understand by that? He does

798
01:02:15,546 --> 01:02:19,190
it muscularly. Pulls himself together, Mr. Eustace.

799
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:26,270
So everybody chronically pulls themselves together.

800
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:31,042
It's so funny, if you get a person to just lie on the floor and

801
01:02:31,066 --> 01:02:31,750
relax,

802
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,600
there's the floor under you as firm as can be holding you up.

803
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:44,000
Nevertheless, you will detect that the person is making all sorts of tensions

804
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:49,420
lest he should suddenly turn into

805
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,440
a nasty jello on the floor.

806
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:59,548
So that chronic tension, which in Sanskrit is called samkocha,

807
01:02:59,644 --> 01:03:01,200
which means contraction,

808
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,740
is the root of what we call the feeling of the ego.

809
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,960
So that, in other words, this feeling of tightness

810
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:14,000
is the physical referent for

811
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:17,160
the psychological image of ourselves.

812
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:22,120
So that we get the ego as the marriage of an illusion to a futility.

813
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:27,156
Even though the idea of an I with a name,

814
01:03:27,228 --> 01:03:30,902
with a being is naturally useful for

815
01:03:30,926 --> 01:03:35,142
social communication, provided we know what we're doing

816
01:03:35,246 --> 01:03:37,570
and take it for what it is.

817
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:45,130
But we are so hung up on this concept

818
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:52,662
that it confuses us even in

819
01:03:52,686 --> 01:03:55,880
the proposition that it might be possible for us to feel other bud.
