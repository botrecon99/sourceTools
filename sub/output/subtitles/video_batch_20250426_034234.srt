1
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,222
It's astonishing. All this is only 20 or

2
00:00:39,246 --> 00:00:41,770
30 minutes from the heart of San Francisco.

3
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,650
Not a human habitation in sight anywhere.

4
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,700
I've been living out here for some months to

5
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,652
write and to absorb an atmosphere that is

6
00:00:56,836 --> 00:01:00,332
different from the city. To try and find out what

7
00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:03,612
is the essential difference. Between the world of

8
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:05,160
nature and the world of man.

9
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,100
Because there's an obvious difference, like the difference of

10
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,180
artistic styles. No one, for example, would confuse

11
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,560
a painting by Leonardo with a painting by Picasso.

12
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,550
Or museum by Bach with music by Shostakovich.

13
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,410
And in the same way, there seems to be a complete difference of

14
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,602
style. Between the

15
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:35,378
things that human beings do and the things

16
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:38,642
that nature does. Even though human beings are

17
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,150
themselves part of nature.

18
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,570
On the one hand, nature is

19
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,390
wiggly. Everything wiggles.

20
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,950
The outlines of the hills,

21
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,150
the shapes of the trees.

22
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,390
The way the wind brushes the grass,

23
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,250
the clouds, tracks of

24
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,790
streams. It all wiggles.

25
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:12,678
And for some reason or other, we find wiggly things

26
00:02:12,874 --> 00:02:14,890
very difficult to keep track of.

27
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,542
And, you know, we say to people, keep still so that I can see you.

28
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:22,370
Keep still for the camera.

29
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,090
And we say, well, let's get things straightened out.

30
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,170
Let's get this ironed out. Let's get it all squared away.

31
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,090
And then somehow we think we understand things.

32
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,888
When we have translated them into

33
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:43,340
terms of straight lines and squares.

34
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,180
Maybe that's why they call a rather rigid people squares.

35
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,700
But it doesn't fit nature.

36
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,500
You know, wherever human beings have been around

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,280
and done their thing, you find

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,500
rectangles. We live in boxes.

39
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,352
Our streets, especially across states like

40
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:16,352
Kansas and Nebraska. Are laid out in a grid pattern. Why,

41
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:21,520
they even dropped a grid pattern on top of San Francisco with

42
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,340
all those hills so that cars run away.

43
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,072
Because it seems that the human beings

44
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:32,660
really has a very simple kind of mind.

45
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,820
And all this wiggliness is too complicated.

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,360
I don't think it really is complicated because, after all,

47
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,104
it's very simple to move, say,

48
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:52,420
to raise something. Or to open and close your hand.

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,340
It's perfectly easy because we don't have to think about it.

50
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:01,010
Things become complicated only when we think about them.

51
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,942
And that's because we're trying to translate them into a

52
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:09,702
form of life. Which is very much simpler and cruder than

53
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:11,650
the forms of life we're talking about.

54
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,742
A triangle is very much simpler and cruder than a

55
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:20,810
mountain. Even though you may represent a mountain,

56
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,580
a triangle.

57
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,360
Human beings are just as wiggly as

58
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,232
nature. And our brains are an incredible

59
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:36,832
mess of wiggles. And that's the part of ourselves that we

60
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:38,380
understand least of all.

61
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,504
I'm afraid the problem is partly due to Mr. Euclid, who invented

62
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:49,060
geometry because he didn't really measure the earth.

63
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,968
He measured and gave us ideas about the very simple forms

64
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:56,536
in his own mind. And perhaps we should come to the conclusion

65
00:04:56,568 --> 00:04:59,100
that he really had a rather weakening intellect.

66
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,980
Because sometimes when I'm in the middle of all this,

67
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,056
I feel as if I were in the middle

68
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:11,580
of an amazing brain.

69
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,510
In other words, the brain is a network of interconnected neurons.

70
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,122
And each one of those neurons is a fairly simple affair.

71
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:26,834
Because it either fires or it doesn't fire.

72
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:30,030
It gives you the message on or off, yes or no.

73
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,298
But what we call things, the plants,

74
00:05:35,474 --> 00:05:39,794
birds, trees, are far more complicated

75
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:43,500
than a neuron. And there are billions of them,

76
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,500
and they are all living together in a network.

77
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,020
Just as there is an interdependence of flowers and bees.

78
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,424
Where there are no flowers, there are no bees. And where there are no bees,

79
00:05:57,472 --> 00:06:00,260
there are no flowers. They're really one organism.

80
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,226
And so, in the same way, everything in nature depends

81
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:10,990
on everything else. So it's interconnected.

82
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,706
And so the many, many patterns of interconnections lock

83
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:19,642
it all together into a unity, which is, however, much too complicated

84
00:06:19,706 --> 00:06:23,790
for us to think about, except in very, very simple, crude ways.

85
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,670
But I am part of all this.

86
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,034
I am, as it were, one of the cells in this tremendous brain,

87
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:38,440
which I can't understand because the

88
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,260
part cannot comprehend the whole.

89
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,832
And yet, at the same time, I don't feel like

90
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:51,464
so many people seem to feel that I'm

91
00:06:51,592 --> 00:06:54,340
a foreigner or a stranger in this world.

92
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,200
Its aesthetic forms somehow appeal to me

93
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,066
more than most of the aesthetic forms

94
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:05,510
which men produce.

95
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,002
I feel in it as if in

96
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:18,018
the same way, when you see a flower in a field, it's really the

97
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:21,426
whole field that is flowering. Because the flower couldn't

98
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,802
exist in that particular place without the special surroundings of

99
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:28,374
the field that it has. You only find flowers

100
00:07:28,562 --> 00:07:32,302
in surroundings which will support them. So in

101
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,646
the same way you only find human beings on a planet

102
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:39,406
of this kind, with an atmosphere of this kind, with temperature of this kind

103
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:42,010
supplied by a convenient neighboring star.

104
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,822
And so, just as the flower is a

105
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:52,046
flowering of the field, I feel myself as a

106
00:07:52,198 --> 00:07:57,560
personing, a manning peopling the whole universe.

107
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:04,452
In other words, I seem like everything else to

108
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:08,920
be a center,

109
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,380
a sort of vortex at which the whole

110
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,160
energy of the universe realizes itself, comes alive,

111
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,996
a sort of aperture through which the whole universe

112
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:22,620
is conscious of itself, self.

113
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,232
In other words, I go with it as a center to

114
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:29,260
a circumference.

115
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,576
You know, the Astrologers, in theory at least,

116
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,432
may not have been so far wrong when in trying to

117
00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:42,488
draw a picture of a human mind or soul,

118
00:08:42,664 --> 00:08:46,600
they drew a very crude map of the whole universe centered

119
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,242
on the time and place of

120
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:53,270
the birth of that particular person. It's not a bad idea.

121
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,938
But I don't think the astrologers know how to read their maps

122
00:08:58,034 --> 00:08:59,830
because the maps are too crude.

123
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,202
But the essential point is obviously that each one

124
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:08,482
of us, not only human beings, but every leaf,

125
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:09,750
every weed,

126
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,122
exists in the way it does only because everything else around it

127
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:19,792
does. And in other words, there's a relationship between the

128
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,296
center and the circumference, which is rather

129
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:26,180
like the relationship between the poles of a magnet.

130
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,576
Without the center, no circumference. Without the circumference,

131
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:34,304
no center. And although

132
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:37,952
we say of poles that they're the

133
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:41,020
poles apart, that is to say, extremely different,

134
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,282
there's something between them. Just as the north and south

135
00:09:48,306 --> 00:09:51,550
poles of a magnet are united by the magnet,

136
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:58,170
so the individual in the universe are

137
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,070
inseparable.

138
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,706
But the curious thing is that while that's rather

139
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,342
easy to see in theory, very few people are

140
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:12,830
aware of it in a. In an important,

141
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,930
strong way like one is aware of blue in blue sky

142
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,690
or of the heat in fire.

143
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,410
It's more of an idea than it is of a realization.

144
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,622
And so it strikes me more

145
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:35,186
and more that our failure

146
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:39,282
to feel at home in

147
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:43,330
this astonishing brain in which we live is

148
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,026
the result of

149
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:50,738
a basic

150
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:56,562
initial mistake in our thinking about the world and

151
00:10:56,586 --> 00:10:59,150
is in turn the cause of.

152
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,920
Of what is beginning to look like the failure of our technology,

153
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,052
of the fact that everything we're doing to try to improve the

154
00:11:11,076 --> 00:11:14,840
world was a success in the short run,

155
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,600
made amazing initial improvements. But in the long run,

156
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,892
we seem to be destroying the

157
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,840
planet by our very efforts to control it and improve it.

158
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,720
And it strikes me that that is because we are really too

159
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,192
simple minded to understand what

160
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:38,872
we're doing. When we interfere with the natural

161
00:11:38,936 --> 00:11:42,380
world strongly and on a vast scale,

162
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,392
we don't really interfere with it because that would suggest that we

163
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,500
were something different from it, something outside.

164
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,270
But I think what we're doing

165
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,610
is we are understanding it in

166
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,750
terms of languages,

167
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:11,190
numbers, in terms of a logic

168
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:20,422
which is too simple for the job, too crude for the job to

169
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:21,330
begin with.

170
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,638
We understand everything in terms of words or numbers,

171
00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:30,330
and they're stretched out in rows, in lines,

172
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,494
and our eyes have to scan those lines in order to understand

173
00:12:35,582 --> 00:12:39,090
them. But when I scan this view,

174
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,650
I don't do it line by line. By line,

175
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,220
I see the whole thing at once.

176
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,592
I take it in with, as it were,

177
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:54,180
a wide angle lens.

178
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,120
But when I try to understand the world through literature and

179
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,944
through mathematics, I have to scan lines.

180
00:13:06,992 --> 00:13:10,300
You know, that's why it takes us so long to get educated in school,

181
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,540
because our eyes have to scan and

182
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,760
organize miles and miles of print.

183
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,260
And that takes us 20 years or more to get

184
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,840
through it. But life

185
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,908
happens. Changes go on

186
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:32,252
too rapidly for that. Because, you see, in the

187
00:13:32,276 --> 00:13:35,240
world, everything is happening all together, everywhere at once.

188
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,998
And meanwhile, we with our myopic little minds are working

189
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:44,966
it out step by step because we are greatly assisted by the rapidity

190
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,090
of the computer.

191
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,462
But even so, the computer is still looking at

192
00:13:51,486 --> 00:13:54,982
things in rows. As the magnetic tape goes through and is scanned by the

193
00:13:55,006 --> 00:13:57,890
computer, it's still all going along in a single track.

194
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,052
And I suppose then our difficulty is that we have lamentably

195
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:10,140
one track minds in an

196
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,480
infinitely many tracked universe.

197
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,012
And we may have to come to the alarming conclusion that

198
00:14:18,036 --> 00:14:20,520
the universe is smarter than we are.

199
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,190
But, you know, that's you. That's the real you,

200
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,950
the you that goes on of itself.

201
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,590
It's not the symbol,

202
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,890
it's not the person. It's you

203
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,602
that's happening as when you breathe. Yes, you can get the

204
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:52,282
feeling that I am breathing by shoving your breath. But your breath

205
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:56,100
goes on day in and day out without your doing

206
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,396
anything about it or even thinking of it. The same way your brain is functioning

207
00:14:59,428 --> 00:15:03,364
without your forcing it. So when you come to a

208
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:06,516
dead end, and we are individually and socially

209
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:09,760
now in 1971,

210
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,180
at a dead end, this is

211
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,120
the moment at which it is said man's extremity is God's opportunity

212
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,928
because we have to stop. And when we stop,

213
00:15:23,984 --> 00:15:27,032
we find a world that is happening rather

214
00:15:27,096 --> 00:15:29,660
than being done, being shoved.

215
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,624
And that happening, as distinct

216
00:15:33,672 --> 00:15:37,416
from doing, is our fundamental self. And our fundamental self

217
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:39,500
is not something just inside the skin.

218
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,740
It's everything around us with which we connect.

219
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,346
When you look out of your eyes at nature happening

220
00:15:51,378 --> 00:15:53,070
out there, you're looking at you.

221
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,510
I'm not going to say what we should do from then on,

222
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,482
but simply that before we think of

223
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:07,990
doing anything in this critical situation,

224
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,242
we realize the completely illusory nature of the

225
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:17,610
beings that we think we are and get

226
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:21,510
back again to the beings that we really are,

227
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,290
which includes all

228
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,430
this outside world

229
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,670
no longer left outside.

230
00:17:12,489 --> 00:18:14,836
SA I've

231
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:18,612
just come back from Los Angeles. I was

232
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:22,960
down there to meet with a group of rather important people,

233
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,520
people in the movie industry, scientists and so on.

234
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,692
Who were considering calling

235
00:18:32,756 --> 00:18:36,468
a congress of the best minds in the world

236
00:18:36,524 --> 00:18:41,140
to meet in Los Angeles in the near future to

237
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,880
be a kind of planetary alarm conference.

238
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,560
They wanted scientists and statesmen,

239
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,200
religious leaders,

240
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,480
and to do something to

241
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,900
impress upon the world through all the media that

242
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,720
we are in very serious danger of

243
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,528
destroying the biosphere, that is to say the whole envelope

244
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:12,816
of living creatures which covers this planet through pollution,

245
00:19:12,928 --> 00:19:15,728
overpopulation, nuclear fallout,

246
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,860
poisoning of our food and very lack of food.

247
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,872
And we met to discuss the problem of organizing this conference.

248
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:28,090
And here were all these brilliant people and

249
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,590
it came over us that we really didn't know what we ought to say.

250
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,962
I mean, you can scream and create a state of panic, but that won't do

251
00:19:35,986 --> 00:19:39,802
any good. And when

252
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:43,002
it came down to it, we didn't know what

253
00:19:43,026 --> 00:19:46,550
we ought to say because we really don't know what to do.

254
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,284
Some things that we might do, for example, to increase the food supply

255
00:19:52,332 --> 00:19:56,000
with high yield crops, may be ecological mistakes.

256
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,980
And so the consensus of almost everybody at the meeting was

257
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,292
that in some way or other the human race has

258
00:20:05,316 --> 00:20:09,100
to learn how to leave the world alone and let what is called

259
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,876
the natural homeostasis, that is the self balancing process

260
00:20:12,948 --> 00:20:15,160
of nature, take care of the mess.

261
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,280
Now how are we going to do that?

262
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:29,050
This is Japanese ceremonial tea.

263
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,210
It's good on a cold day.

264
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,398
See, our problem is we don't really know how to stop. We've got something

265
00:20:39,454 --> 00:20:41,930
started and we see it's going in a wrong direction.

266
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,430
And I think the difficulty is to borrow an old

267
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:49,446
Chinese saying, that when the wrong man uses

268
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:52,530
the right means, the right means work in the wrong way.

269
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,490
In other words, there's something wrong with the way we think.

270
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,410
And while that is there, everything we do will be a mess.

271
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,690
Now what is it that's wrong?

272
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,490
Now, as far as I can see, the basic mistake is

273
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,024
that we've invented this wonderful system of language and

274
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:18,560
calculation and

275
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,984
that it is at once too simple

276
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:24,300
to deal with the complexity of the world.

277
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,600
And also we are liable to confuse that system of

278
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,440
symbols with the world itself. Just as we confuse, say, money with

279
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,720
wealth. A lot of people are in business to make money

280
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,644
instead of wealth. When they make the money, they don't know what to do with

281
00:21:39,652 --> 00:21:40,200
it.

282
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,996
And so in the same way we confuse

283
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:53,804
happiness with status and we confuse

284
00:21:53,852 --> 00:21:57,948
ourselves as living organisms which are one with this whole universe,

285
00:21:58,124 --> 00:22:00,320
with something we call our personality.

286
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,680
Now what is our personality?

287
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,950
Our personality is what we call our image,

288
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,650
our image of ourselves and also our thought about ourselves,

289
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,910
our idea of ourselves. This is the person,

290
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,154
in other words, what people meet and understand.

291
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:24,390
And what I understand as Alan Watts is a big act,

292
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,190
which is not really me.

293
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,820
Because in the image of Alan Watts, there are not all

294
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,388
my unconscious processes, both psychological and physical.

295
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:38,812
The construction of my brain is not contained in the concept

296
00:22:38,876 --> 00:22:42,092
Alan Watts. And the concept Alan Watts does

297
00:22:42,116 --> 00:22:45,340
not contain the inseparable relationships which I

298
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,020
have with all the rest of the universe. And therefore, that concept is

299
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,492
a fraud. And when it's mistaken for the

300
00:22:52,516 --> 00:22:56,780
real me, there's a confusion. Because if

301
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,604
somebody says to me, alan Watts, do something about the concept,

302
00:23:00,652 --> 00:23:03,852
Alan Watts can't do anything, in other

303
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:06,000
words, because it's only a concept,

304
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,900
you can't make it lift a weight. Just as

305
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,484
three is a concept, three, the number. You can't make just plain

306
00:23:13,532 --> 00:23:17,532
three do anything. So also you can't wrap up parcels with

307
00:23:17,556 --> 00:23:21,600
the equator. It's a useful imaginary line, but it can't do anything.

308
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,452
But we all feel that this concept of ourselves, which we call our personality

309
00:23:27,516 --> 00:23:31,032
or our ego, can do something because we think it

310
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:33,420
really exists. And I'll tell you why we think it exists.

311
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,104
What happens when you. If I were to say to you, now, look hard at

312
00:23:40,112 --> 00:23:42,500
the television screen, really look at it.

313
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,032
What do you do as distinct from just watching it in the ordinary way?

314
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:49,460
When you say, now I really got to see that. What do you do?

315
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,126
Notice that you tighten muscles all around here,

316
00:23:54,248 --> 00:23:57,074
that you frown a little, you clench your teeth,

317
00:23:57,122 --> 00:24:01,270
perhaps. Now, what has that got to do with seeing anything clearly?

318
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,554
Absolutely nothing to do with it. Same thing when you listen carefully.

319
00:24:05,602 --> 00:24:08,850
Now, listen, catch everything that's said when you start

320
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,354
tightening up around your ears. That has nothing to do with hearing.

321
00:24:12,402 --> 00:24:16,226
Clearer now, from the moment we were little children,

322
00:24:16,378 --> 00:24:20,140
when teachers in class screamed at us, pay attention. We go

323
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,916
tight in various ways, either to

324
00:24:23,988 --> 00:24:27,420
see or hear more clearly, to concentrate or

325
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,980
to will something which is supposed to be difficult to do and

326
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,564
that constitutes a habitual tension over the whole body that's

327
00:24:35,612 --> 00:24:39,324
there almost all the time. And that feeling of unnecessary

328
00:24:39,372 --> 00:24:42,732
tension is, as it were, the material sensation

329
00:24:42,796 --> 00:24:45,560
upon which we fasten this concept of I,

330
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,324
we hang it on to that feeling. The concept

331
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:53,684
is not us. The feeling of tension is completely

332
00:24:53,732 --> 00:24:57,092
phony. It has nothing to do with success in seeing, hearing or

333
00:24:57,116 --> 00:25:00,852
acting. And so we get the marriage of an illusion

334
00:25:00,996 --> 00:25:04,760
with a falsehood and that we call ourselves.

335
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,852
And no wonder we feel cut off from everything, alienated, frightened of

336
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:09,760
life and death.

337
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,230
So what has to happen is we have to come

338
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,570
back to a sane

339
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:25,450
view of our own life, which is

340
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,614
the way we really are an organism functioning

341
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:32,702
in terms of the whole environment, with the whole environment,

342
00:25:32,886 --> 00:25:36,174
instead of this funny little separate personality. But how are we

343
00:25:36,182 --> 00:25:39,370
going to do that? People say, oh, you can't change human

344
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:43,070
nature overnight. You're asking us to give up the ego.

345
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,550
And that's the most difficult of all things to do.

346
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:51,470
Actually, it isn't, because the ego doesn't exist.

347
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,274
But of course, if you try to give up your ego with your ego,

348
00:25:55,402 --> 00:25:57,830
then it will take you to the end of time.

349
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:03,470
Because this is the point. You can't transform yourself.

350
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,296
You can't make yourself sane. You can't make yourself loving.

351
00:26:08,408 --> 00:26:10,700
You can't make yourself unselfish.

352
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,720
And yet it's absolutely necessary that we be

353
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,420
that way. It's absolutely necessary.

354
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,152
If we are going to hand over the

355
00:26:24,176 --> 00:26:27,320
direction of nature to nature, which is what it

356
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,650
comes to, it's absolutely necessary that

357
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,350
we let go of ourselves. And it can't be done.

358
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,706
Not by anything that we call doing it.

359
00:26:38,778 --> 00:26:41,826
Acting willing, or even just accepting things.

360
00:26:41,978 --> 00:26:44,110
You can't do it. Why?

361
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:48,674
Because you don't really exist as that kind of a separate

362
00:26:48,722 --> 00:26:53,110
ego or personality. It's just an idea based on a phony feeling.

363
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,350
So when it comes down to it,

364
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,962
it's shocking news for us, for the

365
00:27:03,986 --> 00:27:06,270
human race, for our pride.

366
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,858
You're only making a mess by trying to put things

367
00:27:10,914 --> 00:27:14,570
straight. You're trying to straighten out a wiggly world,

368
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,270
and no wonder you're in trouble.

369
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:22,390
So you can't do anything. So you can't transform yourself.

370
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,394
And what can you do? What happens then if you actually

371
00:27:27,482 --> 00:27:30,818
realize you've come to a dead end and the human

372
00:27:30,874 --> 00:27:33,510
race has come to a dead end? In my opinion.

373
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,390
What then? Commit suicide?

374
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,378
Or is there something else? What happens

375
00:27:43,554 --> 00:27:46,190
when you just wait? There's nothing you can do.

376
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:51,498
You watch and

377
00:27:51,554 --> 00:27:55,390
all you see is what goes on that is happening of itself.

378
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,390
You are breathing, the wind is blowing,

379
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,882
the trees are waving. Your blood is circulating,

380
00:28:04,026 --> 00:28:07,070
your nerves are tingling. It's all going on itself.

381
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:12,150
The whole theory of political control

382
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,940
by imposition of the rule of law from

383
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,764
above. Which is, alas, the Christian theory

384
00:28:19,812 --> 00:28:22,600
of the universe. This is the way God is operating.

385
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,884
God is personally aware with his full,

386
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:31,160
total consciousness of every atom of existence.

387
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,708
Think of having to be occupied with the vagaries of

388
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:40,390
every human mind. Poor God,

389
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:44,190
the victim of his own power game.

390
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:48,070
And Lao Tzu is saying that in the art of ruling,

391
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,550
you do not use force.

392
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,310
You never press the issue.

393
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,870
He likens the functioning of the dao to water.

394
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,698
And he says now, water is always

395
00:29:03,754 --> 00:29:05,830
taking the line of least resistance.

396
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,084
It doesn't strive, it always seeks

397
00:29:10,132 --> 00:29:13,840
the low level which men abhor because they always want to be on top.

398
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,036
But what can you do with water? You can't cut it, you can't

399
00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:20,480
injure it, you can't compress it.

400
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,540
So he's saying, in other words, if you want to govern the nation,

401
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,360
you must behave like water.

402
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,692
He has a conception of the dao, which is,

403
00:29:33,716 --> 00:29:38,000
as it were, the exact opposite of all conceptions of God.

404
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,764
He says this the great dao flows everywhere,

405
00:29:42,812 --> 00:29:46,604
both to the left and to the right. It loves and nourishes

406
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:51,068
all things, but does not lord it over them. And when

407
00:29:51,204 --> 00:29:54,200
merits are accomplished, it lays no claim to them.

408
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,770
It says, the swishing wind does not last out morning.

409
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:03,026
The pelting rain does not go on all day. If heaven and earth cannot

410
00:30:03,058 --> 00:30:07,010
keep these things up, how much less can have? So he has

411
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:10,418
an idea of the emperor as a.

412
00:30:10,554 --> 00:30:14,642
An anonymous sort of person who would be, in other words,

413
00:30:14,706 --> 00:30:18,690
to a political community in

414
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,658
the same way as today. The sanitary engineer

415
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:26,908
is never.

416
00:30:26,964 --> 00:30:30,492
Would you imagine the sanitary engineer going through

417
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:34,092
town in a great car with a police escort and flags in all

418
00:30:34,116 --> 00:30:38,204
directions. Nobody even knows who the sanitary engineer

419
00:30:38,252 --> 00:30:41,080
is. And yet he's a very important official.

420
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,000
Without him, there would be health problems and all sorts of difficulties.

421
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,438
But because he's in charge of the sewers, everybody would

422
00:30:50,494 --> 00:30:53,530
say, well, that's not very glamorous.

423
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,610
And Lao Tzu is saying that the. The chief official of the state

424
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:02,090
should have the same attitude as the man in charge of the sewers,

425
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:07,110
that the less he parades himself, the more

426
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:11,250
effective he can be. The less that's known about it better.

427
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:17,010
So he says, the energies of the emperor should be directed to

428
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:20,674
keeping the minds of the people unpreoccupied and their bellies

429
00:31:20,722 --> 00:31:24,310
well filled. In other words,

430
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,322
let's not have news about politics. Let the

431
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:31,390
newspapers be full of interesting things,

432
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,538
not political things. But our newspapers, which are all about politics,

433
00:31:35,714 --> 00:31:37,670
are full of catastrophes.

434
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,748
You open the newspaper and what do you read? What is news? Bad? Bad news

435
00:31:42,804 --> 00:31:46,428
is news. But the saying, you know, no news

436
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:49,996
is good news. All news is bad news.

437
00:31:50,148 --> 00:31:54,028
They don't say the great things that are going on very

438
00:31:54,084 --> 00:31:57,900
rarely. So Lao Tzu advocates no news

439
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,876
at all. No discussion of politics.

440
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:04,268
He says, my ideal state would be a small

441
00:32:04,324 --> 00:32:07,720
one in which you could hear the chickens in the neighboring state.

442
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:12,450
And the There would be no apparent government.

443
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:17,302
It's a kind of anarchy. But of course,

444
00:32:17,406 --> 00:32:21,210
anarchy depends upon everybody being responsible.

445
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,902
Therefore, if you are going to have a control of

446
00:32:26,926 --> 00:32:28,690
an enormous amount of information,

447
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:33,814
it has to be delegated and you have to trust them all

448
00:32:33,902 --> 00:32:37,754
to work together. A highly organized system

449
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:42,074
where a lot of detail is going on has to be a system of mutual

450
00:32:42,122 --> 00:32:45,242
trust. There is no way of bossing it if you

451
00:32:45,266 --> 00:32:49,270
want to have it at all. You have to have it by letting go

452
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,350
and saying to all the units in it, come on, let's play together.

453
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,586
But the moment you come on uptight about them and say,

454
00:32:58,738 --> 00:33:02,292
now I want an accounting from each

455
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:05,780
one of you, each one of them feels a little

456
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,444
mean about it and will conceal

457
00:33:09,492 --> 00:33:13,028
information. And you, if you're going to keep charge of the whole thing

458
00:33:13,084 --> 00:33:17,040
in that style of behavior, are going to have your hands full,

459
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,492
two full, you won't be able

460
00:33:21,516 --> 00:33:22,560
to watch it all.

461
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,062
So therefore every organic complexity

462
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:35,090
works by the delegation of authority.

463
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:39,130
Every organic unity is a system of love,

464
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,610
that is to say of mutual trust, which says,

465
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,250
thank God I've got you around.

466
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,566
I often think about this. Somebody does something that's marvelous

467
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:54,952
and I think, what a relief that you could do that. And I

468
00:33:54,976 --> 00:33:56,020
didn't have to.

469
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,056
All that effort that you put into doing this is so beautiful.

470
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:07,900
And I just relieved me of the necessity.

471
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,860
See, that's the way that the life principle really works.

472
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,000
In complete opposition to any idea of life

473
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:21,740
Lordship of all the credit belongs to

474
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,548
me. You as an ego, supposing you've

475
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,480
done, you've achieved something great.

476
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,852
And you say, no, it wasn't my ego that did,

477
00:34:33,316 --> 00:34:36,640
was all these myriad little molecules and cells,

478
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,732
each one of whom contributed to this extraordinary thing

479
00:34:40,756 --> 00:34:44,300
that I did. See, you can go in that

480
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,938
way towards infinite diversity and say of everything

481
00:34:47,994 --> 00:34:50,590
that you did, no, it wasn't me, it was my people.

482
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,590
It was all these little fellows who were.

483
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,562
Each one of them did it to the degree that you

484
00:34:58,586 --> 00:35:01,190
go towards the infinitude of the little ones.

485
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:06,226
To that extent you have a true sense

486
00:35:06,258 --> 00:35:07,190
of unity.

487
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,802
Whereas if you don't give any credit to the little ones and you say,

488
00:35:12,826 --> 00:35:16,196
well, I just push them around on you don't realize

489
00:35:16,228 --> 00:35:19,956
how things are put together. This is the true inner

490
00:35:19,988 --> 00:35:23,492
meaning of the principle of non duality. That the truest

491
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:27,800
unity is the same thing as the most detailed multiplicity.

492
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:32,164
You don't know what you mean by unity unless you understand multiplicity.

493
00:35:32,292 --> 00:35:35,492
The one throws out the other idea. They balance each other like the

494
00:35:35,516 --> 00:35:38,948
back and the front. So in exactly the same way, the more

495
00:35:39,084 --> 00:35:42,570
you go for highly articulate multiplicity,

496
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,190
the more you get unity.

497
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,070
The whole idea of the giving in to the other,

498
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:53,430
trusting it to do it.

499
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,810
So this is the real secret underlying the democratic

500
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,250
principle, the notion of what

501
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:05,898
a republic is as distinct from

502
00:36:05,954 --> 00:36:09,290
a monolithic monarchy,

503
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:14,570
where the people cease to trust themselves

504
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,210
and say to an authority,

505
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,970
please, you take care of us. Instead,

506
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,130
it works exactly the opposite direction.

507
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:32,086
And that direction is the opposite direction of the way

508
00:36:32,158 --> 00:36:36,866
in which all living organisms flow

509
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:38,790
and manifest themselves.

510
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,760
If you believe that God is a monarch,

511
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,000
an absolute, omniscient and omnipotent authority,

512
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,600
shall we say a sort of cosmic ego,

513
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,220
then to claim to be that is to introduce democracy

514
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,300
into the kingdom of heaven to

515
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:36,172
us up divine authority and to speak in

516
00:37:36,196 --> 00:37:38,560
its name without proper authorization.

517
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,620
And they asked Jesus, by what authority do you speak of heaven

518
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,476
or of men? And he was tricky

519
00:37:48,508 --> 00:37:49,960
about answering that one.

520
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,640
He said, by what authority did John the Baptist speak?

521
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,210
And they were nervous about answering that one.

522
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:03,430
So the Gospel of Jesus, which of course was hushed up

523
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:07,414
from its inception, was that,

524
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:11,170
wake up everybody, and find out who you are

525
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:17,750
asking that again. In The Gospel of St. John, they,

526
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,190
pointing to his disciples, may be one, even as you,

527
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,710
Father, and I are one. And when

528
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:28,534
he was accused of blasphemy, the Jews

529
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:32,070
took up stones to stone him, you know, and he said, many good

530
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,222
works have I shown you from the Father, and from which of these do you

531
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,210
stone me?

532
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:43,302
And they said, for a good work we don't stone you, but for blasphemy,

533
00:38:43,366 --> 00:38:45,770
because you, being a man, make yourself God.

534
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,172
Now listen to the reply. He said, is it not written in

535
00:38:50,196 --> 00:38:52,640
your law? I have said ye are gods.

536
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,880
And if that is what the scripture says, it can't be denied.

537
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,212
So why do you tell me I blaspheme because I say I am a

538
00:39:01,236 --> 00:39:02,240
son of God?

539
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:10,348
No answer because

540
00:39:10,404 --> 00:39:13,996
I said I am a son of God. It doesn't say that in your King

541
00:39:14,028 --> 00:39:16,960
James translation. It says, I am the son of God.

542
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,200
And you'll see the the italicized and you will think that that is for emphasis

543
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,800
if you don't realize that passages in italics in the King James Bible

544
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,160
are interpolations by the translators in

545
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,632
Greek, leaving out the definite article is equivalent of having the

546
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:42,158
indefinite article we ask to see you

547
00:39:42,344 --> 00:39:45,970
is a son of God, not O E us to

548
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,946
Theo. So son of in

549
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:54,562
Hebrew and in Arabic means of the

550
00:39:54,586 --> 00:39:57,910
nature of. When we call someone a son of a bitch,

551
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:02,002
we mean bitchy. And so if you call someone a

552
00:40:02,026 --> 00:40:05,650
son of God, you mean divine of

553
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:09,426
the nature of God. As the Nicene Creed subsequently

554
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:12,720
defined it, he is of one substance with the Father.

555
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,852
But what happened was that this being blasphemy for

556
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:21,452
the Jews, it became blasphemy for the

557
00:40:21,476 --> 00:40:24,840
Christians, for anyone else than Jesus to say it.

558
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,228
They said, okay, baby, it was so with you, but there

559
00:40:29,284 --> 00:40:31,560
it stops. No more of this business.

560
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,160
And as a result of that,

561
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,600
Jesus was made irrelevant by pedestalization,

562
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,990
by being kicked upstairs,

563
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:50,970
in spite of the fact that he said, greater works than

564
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,522
these that I do. Shall you do. Oh, no,

565
00:40:54,706 --> 00:40:58,250
upstairs with you, baby. Because we just

566
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,322
can't have that sort of thing going on in a monarchical universe. We are not

567
00:41:01,346 --> 00:41:03,630
going to have democracy in the kingdom of heaven.

568
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:08,900
So this is why the Gospel is impossible.

569
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,860
Because we are supposed to follow the example of Christ,

570
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,180
where he says, for example, be not anxious for the morrow.

571
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,872
Do not worry about what you shall eat, what you shall drink, and what you

572
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:25,152
shall wear. God will take care of you. Doesn't he take

573
00:41:25,176 --> 00:41:28,656
care of the birds? Don't the flowers grow? They're wonderful. They're crazy.

574
00:41:28,688 --> 00:41:32,202
They're great. What are you worrying about? I've never heard a

575
00:41:32,226 --> 00:41:34,630
sermon preached on that. Never.

576
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,990
Because it's totally subversive. The economy would crash.

577
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,882
So they say, oh yes, that's all very well, but he

578
00:41:45,906 --> 00:41:47,230
was the boss's son,

579
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:53,230
see? He had that colossal advantage.

580
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,956
Take up your cross and follow him. Hey, but wait

581
00:41:57,988 --> 00:42:01,680
a minute. I don't know. I'm going to be resurrected three days later.

582
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,196
I can't do all those miracles. He had an unfair

583
00:42:08,228 --> 00:42:09,160
advantage.

584
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,760
So how can you ask us to follow the example of Christ?

585
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,800
But supposing he didn't have an unfair advantage?

586
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,968
Supposing that what was true about

587
00:42:29,024 --> 00:42:34,152
Jesus as a son of God is true of us Only.

588
00:42:34,336 --> 00:42:37,300
Only a few of us know it.

589
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,460
And we are pretty careful to be quiet about it,

590
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,860
lest the same thing happened to us as happened to Jesus.

591
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,520
And indeed it often does.

592
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,372
Now, why talk about this? Is it

593
00:42:57,396 --> 00:43:01,276
interesting? Is it important for

594
00:43:01,428 --> 00:43:04,620
the human being to realize that

595
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,652
in some sense of the Word, whatever it means, he is God, or one

596
00:43:08,676 --> 00:43:12,280
with God. Well, the importance of it is this,

597
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:18,408
that to know that you are God is

598
00:43:18,464 --> 00:43:23,224
another way of saying that you feel completely

599
00:43:23,272 --> 00:43:27,144
with this universe. You feel

600
00:43:27,232 --> 00:43:30,260
profoundly rooted in it and connected with it.

601
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,712
You feel, in other words, that the whole energy which expresses itself in the

602
00:43:34,736 --> 00:43:37,740
galaxies is intimate.

603
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,896
It is not something to which you are a stranger,

604
00:43:43,048 --> 00:43:46,864
but it is that with which you, whatever that is, are intimately

605
00:43:46,912 --> 00:43:50,192
bound up. That in your seeing, your hearing, your talking,

606
00:43:50,256 --> 00:43:51,700
your thinking you're moving,

607
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,180
you express that which it is which moves the sun and other stars.

608
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,936
And if you don't know that if you don't feel that,

609
00:44:04,088 --> 00:44:07,632
well naturally you feel alien. You feel a

610
00:44:07,656 --> 00:44:12,130
stranger in the world. And if you feel a stranger, you feel hostile

611
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:17,582
and therefore you start to bulldoze things about to beat it

612
00:44:17,606 --> 00:44:21,150
up and to try and make the world submit to your

613
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,890
will. And you become a real troublemaker.

614
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:30,638
So I feel also one reason why you become hostile

615
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:34,286
is that feeling that you were just brought into this place, that your father

616
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:37,492
and mother went up to some monkey business that they probably shouldn't have

617
00:44:37,516 --> 00:44:40,532
done, or it was bad rubber goods. And as a result of this, here you

618
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:43,620
are and you didn't ask to be here. Well, you always feel you can turn

619
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,676
around and blame them. You can blame somebody,

620
00:44:46,868 --> 00:44:50,388
you can blame the government, you can blame the rascals, you can blame the,

621
00:44:50,444 --> 00:44:53,844
blame the cheaters. Always supposing you yourself aren't a

622
00:44:53,852 --> 00:44:56,040
rascal, which is a long odds.

623
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:02,750
You always can blame someone, say I

624
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,810
didn't ask for it, take it away.

625
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:14,510
And yet, and yet, and yet very few people are

626
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,330
all too ready to take it away.

627
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,902
And if you don't, if you don't say take

628
00:45:21,926 --> 00:45:25,690
it away, what are you going to do?

629
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:29,390
You've really got to assume responsibility for it.

630
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:33,826
You've got to say yes to what happens.

631
00:45:34,018 --> 00:45:38,002
It's my karma. And that doesn't mean merely.

632
00:45:38,146 --> 00:45:41,190
There are many misinterpretations of the doctrine of karma.

633
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:46,018
It's usually in popularly understood is that what happens to you,

634
00:45:46,154 --> 00:45:49,810
either fortunate or unfortunate, is the result of good or bad

635
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:53,916
deeds in a previous life. Well, that's popular superstition.

636
00:45:54,108 --> 00:45:57,580
The real meaning of karma, the word in Sanskrit means simply

637
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,020
doing. And if I say of an event,

638
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,120
it is your karma, it is saying, it is your doing.

639
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:08,908
So the Exposition, a book which would expound karma

640
00:46:09,004 --> 00:46:12,120
would be not so much a who done it as a you done it.

641
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,200
But that seems fantastic.

642
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:46,130
Allow ourselves the

643
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,858
idea that life is not

644
00:46:49,914 --> 00:46:54,034
serious because somehow

645
00:46:54,082 --> 00:46:57,830
you feel if you aren't engaged

646
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:02,818
in something serious, you're a loafer,

647
00:47:02,994 --> 00:47:05,990
you're not contributing to the social welfare.

648
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:11,430
And so in this way the artist has

649
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:14,550
a peculiar role in this

650
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:18,930
society. Very, very interesting because

651
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:23,606
the artist is a very deceptive

652
00:47:23,638 --> 00:47:26,806
fellow. He appears

653
00:47:26,838 --> 00:47:30,390
to be the supreme luxury, the irrelevant fellow.

654
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:34,038
You can afford an artist, you can afford to buy paintings if

655
00:47:34,094 --> 00:47:37,940
you have surplus money, that's a luxury.

656
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,712
So you can support an artist and we call it fine arts,

657
00:47:43,856 --> 00:47:49,552
the completely useless person who

658
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:53,504
makes paintings which are sort of big labels or posters that you stick

659
00:47:53,552 --> 00:47:56,700
on your utilitarian walls to decorate them.

660
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:01,152
But on the other hand, the artist

661
00:48:01,216 --> 00:48:05,036
is the man who shows

662
00:48:05,068 --> 00:48:08,520
you the future long before everybody else sees it.

663
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,120
The artist is the eye opener, just because

664
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:18,940
the artist is distinct in role from

665
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,120
the preacher and the philosopher.

666
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:28,646
So the. The role of the artist is very fascinating because

667
00:48:28,718 --> 00:48:32,454
he appears to be the. The clown, the jester,

668
00:48:32,582 --> 00:48:35,330
the absolutely unimportant and irrelevant person.

669
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:41,250
And yet it's actually through the artist that we learn how to live.

670
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:48,134
Not through the preacher, not through the philosopher,

671
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:49,770
not through the professor.

672
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:55,310
It is the artist teaches us, whether he does it visually in

673
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:58,782
painting or on sculpture, tactually over, above all in

674
00:48:58,806 --> 00:48:59,370
music.

675
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:06,910
You should read, if you can get hold of it, an interview with

676
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:10,494
George Harrison, one of the Beatles, in a

677
00:49:10,502 --> 00:49:12,730
recent issue of the East Village Other,

678
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:17,246
where he explains the deep philosophy

679
00:49:17,278 --> 00:49:21,000
of music that they understand and

680
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:26,312
follow. How the

681
00:49:26,336 --> 00:49:30,072
very nature of sound reveals

682
00:49:30,136 --> 00:49:33,864
the meaning of the world and why, because of this, he regards

683
00:49:33,912 --> 00:49:37,820
himself as a Hindu. In Hinduism,

684
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,300
the fundamental source of life is called vak.

685
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,776
Vak in Sanskrit means the word to speak,

686
00:49:46,968 --> 00:49:50,264
but not so much the word that communicates as the sound,

687
00:49:50,312 --> 00:49:53,340
the utterance, the flow of tone.

688
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,008
So you have in India the use of mantra,

689
00:49:58,184 --> 00:50:01,660
the use of chanted words,

690
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,900
as one of the very basic forms of yoga,

691
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,220
understanding the mystery of the world.

692
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,900
The Hindus use the word om,

693
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,016
which would be spelled out A, U, m because

694
00:50:19,088 --> 00:50:22,700
the letter A, ah is in the back of the throat.

695
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:29,900
You push it through the vowel to a lips.

696
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,060
So the word om comprehends the whole range of sound.

697
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,220
It's called the pranava.

698
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:41,074
All sounds are basically the sound of but

699
00:50:41,162 --> 00:50:45,442
varied. The word that not only signifies

700
00:50:45,586 --> 00:50:48,190
but also is what there is.

701
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:51,670
Everything is own, Sweet ohm.

702
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:56,642
The whole universe is of his own and

703
00:50:56,666 --> 00:51:00,322
it has no meaning except it is the

704
00:51:00,346 --> 00:51:01,790
very pulse of life.

705
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,240
Some of you have read a book of mine called the Choir's Cosmology,

706
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:18,012
in which I referred to once a very curious

707
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:21,480
experience I have with Hindu music.

708
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:26,364
I happen to have acquired from Timothy Leary some of

709
00:51:26,372 --> 00:51:30,822
this extraordinary Mexican mushroom. And I

710
00:51:30,846 --> 00:51:34,230
was feeling awful. I come

711
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:37,654
back from a trip to the east tired and I had a sore

712
00:51:37,702 --> 00:51:39,770
throat and it was just lousy.

713
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:46,102
So I took this thing and I

714
00:51:46,126 --> 00:51:50,290
found myself listening to this Hindu music. I didn't know what it was

715
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:55,600
and I thought when I listened to this, what kind

716
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,740
of idiocy is going on?

717
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,416
I thought, you see, my friend with whom I was spending

718
00:52:02,448 --> 00:52:06,272
the day was a pretty wild kind of fellow, and I

719
00:52:06,296 --> 00:52:10,260
thought he'd put on a tape recording of his and his friend's antics.

720
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,180
It was like children Making faces.

721
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,740
I thought, this is just something absolutely absurd going on.

722
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:33,590
So I said, roger, hey, let me see the album.

723
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:38,082
I got the case here. It says, classical Music of

724
00:52:38,106 --> 00:52:41,906
India, edited by Anand Danielu,

725
00:52:42,098 --> 00:52:44,978
who is the most scholarly,

726
00:52:45,074 --> 00:52:48,270
respectable pundit the subject of Hindu music.

727
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:50,770
I said, somebody's pulling my leg.

728
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:55,958
No, not at all. Here was this

729
00:52:56,014 --> 00:52:59,606
just babbling sound. Not only do the dit da

730
00:52:59,638 --> 00:53:02,806
business, but they also could use their voices

731
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:09,078
like oboes. You know how that you'll

732
00:53:09,094 --> 00:53:12,502
put a clothespin on your nose and do an oboe stump. And it sounded like

733
00:53:12,526 --> 00:53:17,712
this. And it was just this whole kind of business of children were

734
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,380
just going out of their heads.

735
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:27,200
Well, I listened to this and I suddenly realized that

736
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,860
that's what life's all about.

737
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:35,140
And, you know, it was the most fantastic, sudden recognition

738
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:40,858
that everything in this world is

739
00:53:40,914 --> 00:53:42,510
gloriously meaningless.

740
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:48,042
That's what's happening. We're all taught by

741
00:53:48,066 --> 00:53:51,498
our mothers and fathers, put a value

742
00:53:51,554 --> 00:53:54,922
on it when it goes a

743
00:53:54,946 --> 00:53:58,042
certain way. The rhythm of life goes in

744
00:53:58,066 --> 00:54:01,130
a certain way. When we say, oh, watch out, watch out,

745
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:04,058
watch out, watch out. Because that may be the end. What will the end be?

746
00:54:04,114 --> 00:54:04,910
Spunk.

747
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,480
What's wrong with that?

748
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,360
Things that stop have to stop.

749
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:20,612
Things that go on have to go off. And things that go off have to

750
00:54:20,636 --> 00:54:24,260
go on. But you see, we get

751
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,612
involved by putting a value on it. All right?

752
00:54:28,636 --> 00:54:31,362
Now, I could say that's bad, you shouldn't do it. But at the same time,

753
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:34,770
getting involved and putting values on, it's all part of the game too.

754
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:39,222
Getting hung up, getting hooked. So you don't get

755
00:54:39,246 --> 00:54:42,810
unhooked by saying to yourself, I shouldn't be attached,

756
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:47,622
I shouldn't do this, I shouldn't do that. All you do is you see

757
00:54:47,646 --> 00:54:50,902
that getting hooked on it is simply another form of

758
00:54:50,926 --> 00:54:54,410
it. More nonsense,

759
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:58,380
more jazz, more the deeper jazz.

760
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,900
When you. When you see a firm,

761
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,432
it has first of all the main branch. Then it

762
00:55:07,456 --> 00:55:10,824
has sub branches. And out of these sub branches

763
00:55:10,872 --> 00:55:14,360
come sub sub branches, and out of the sub sub

764
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,580
branches come sub sub, sub branches. And so you get a firm.

765
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,596
So now you could number each of these levels on which things are happening.

766
00:55:23,688 --> 00:55:27,460
You say, well, this is a number one level. This is a number 42 level.

767
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,360
This is a number 65 level.

768
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:34,660
And you judge events and say, it's good,

769
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:38,420
it's bad, it's proper, it's improper. But what you don't recognize is

770
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,780
that you say something is improper because you thought it was a 63

771
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,000
level, whereas really it was 112.

772
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:49,280
And you didn't know, you didn't realize the level the thing was on.

773
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,092
So actually, in the whole play of

774
00:55:54,116 --> 00:55:58,360
human life, with all its joys and sorrows, its tragedies, its evils, it's good

775
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,840
is just something like a fern.

776
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,108
It has tumors on it. That means just simply another clan is making its life

777
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:11,724
there. The clan of bugs of some kind are living

778
00:56:11,772 --> 00:56:15,276
there too. They're doing their stuff. They're living off the fern.

779
00:56:15,308 --> 00:56:18,204
The fern's living off something else. We're all leaning on each other in one way

780
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:18,920
or another.

781
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:25,110
I saw this whole thing as this fantastic play.

782
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,780
The reason why Zen is so peculiar is

783
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:11,758
that it has to begin with no

784
00:57:11,814 --> 00:57:14,930
doctrines that can be stated in words,

785
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:17,690
nothing that it requires anybody to believe.

786
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:22,254
It has no system of

787
00:57:22,422 --> 00:57:24,290
formulated philosophy.

788
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:28,890
In fact, it doesn't really have anything to say at all.

789
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:33,726
What is remarkable about them is

790
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:37,490
that it endeavors to convey its message,

791
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:42,958
the realization which constitutes awakening in Buddhism

792
00:57:43,134 --> 00:57:46,210
without the intermediary of words and ideas.

793
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:50,286
There are four statements which sum up the

794
00:57:50,358 --> 00:57:53,410
character of Zen Buddhism, and they are as follows.

795
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:58,130
A direct transmission of awakening

796
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:03,160
outside the scriptures. No dependence

797
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,660
on words and letters.

798
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,448
Direct pointing and

799
00:58:11,504 --> 00:58:14,700
finally seeing into one's own nature

800
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,040
and becoming a Buddha, which is to say,

801
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,380
an awakened one.

802
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,960
I particularly want to concentrate on what is meant for the moment by

803
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,602
direct pointing, because. Because this is the technique in

804
00:58:29,626 --> 00:58:33,190
which Zen excels. Zen feels

805
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,826
that all that human beings are seeking,

806
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:41,110
all that they really fundamentally desire,

807
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:45,634
whether it be complete contentment

808
00:58:45,682 --> 00:58:49,698
of the heart or understanding

809
00:58:49,794 --> 00:58:53,230
why this universe exists and what our place in it is,

810
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:58,940
all this understanding is

811
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:03,160
not something obscure and far off, but something

812
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:07,480
completely obvious and lying open for us

813
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,884
to anybody who cares to look at it. In this immediate

814
00:59:11,932 --> 00:59:13,720
moment which we are living now,

815
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:19,542
it is as if to say the

816
00:59:19,566 --> 00:59:23,190
whole secret of life, everything that you could

817
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:26,870
possibly desire is yours at this

818
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:30,918
moment. And if you cannot lay hold on it

819
00:59:30,974 --> 00:59:33,330
now, you'll never be able to.

820
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:38,870
The difficulty is that it's very hard to convince people of this

821
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:42,438
by talking about it, because all talk, all systems of

822
00:59:42,494 --> 00:59:45,746
ideas, are in relation to reality itself,

823
00:59:45,878 --> 00:59:48,990
somewhat like a menu in relation to a dinner.

824
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:53,230
And those who try to get comfort,

825
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:57,594
to get wisdom out of books, or by believing

826
00:59:57,642 --> 01:00:00,510
in various systems of ideas and philosophies,

827
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:04,826
such people are really devouring

828
01:00:04,858 --> 01:00:07,230
the menu instead of eating the dinner.

829
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:10,146
Now, how then is 1,

830
01:00:10,437 --> 01:00:14,832
2 divert people's attention from

831
01:00:14,856 --> 01:00:17,540
the menu to the dinner itself?

832
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:22,900
There's only one way, and that is to point directly at the dinner,

833
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:27,392
to stop talking about it, to stop writing about it, and to point

834
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:28,820
at it directly.

835
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:35,200
We're all very convinced indeed that

836
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:39,274
we exist as a kind of self

837
01:00:39,322 --> 01:00:40,190
or ego,

838
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:45,514
and our selfishness is one

839
01:00:45,522 --> 01:00:49,130
of our major problems. It would.

840
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:52,590
Wouldn't it be rather fascinating

841
01:00:53,330 --> 01:01:05,220
to find that when we look for ourselves, we are not really as

842
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:09,092
if where we expected to find ourselves, in the

843
01:01:09,116 --> 01:01:12,900
center of all our experience, we found

844
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,520
only a hole, an empty space.

845
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:21,028
And then the problem of myself,

846
01:01:21,204 --> 01:01:24,612
my happiness, my peace of mind, would have

847
01:01:24,636 --> 01:01:25,640
disappeared.

848
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:31,214
There is no one whom one has to pacify,

849
01:01:31,342 --> 01:01:33,090
whom one has to make happy.

850
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:39,370
You're not actually there.

851
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:44,510
But of course, one can't discover that just by hearing about

852
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:46,330
it. You have to look and see.

853
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:51,934
That's why one of the fundamental questions in all Oriental

854
01:01:51,982 --> 01:01:55,540
philosophy is the simple question, who are you?

855
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:01,240
Look and try to find out who it is that is trying

856
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,340
to find out who it is that is trying to find out.

857
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,600
This is after all a

858
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,072
parable of what everybody is doing, who is engaged in what

859
01:02:14,096 --> 01:02:16,460
we in the west call self seeking.

860
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:22,280
And this is really a stupid as somebody

861
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:27,444
sitting down solemnly in a chair and gnashing and gnashing

862
01:02:27,492 --> 01:02:29,960
away, trying to bite his own teeth.

863
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:36,980
When the Buddha was in the

864
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:40,212
Gridra Kuta mountain, he turned a flower

865
01:02:40,276 --> 01:02:43,240
in his fingers and held it before his listeners.

866
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:46,760
Everyone was silent.

867
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,780
Only Mahakashyapa smiled at this revelation,

868
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,140
although he tried to control the lines of his face.

869
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:00,864
The Buddha said, I have the eye of

870
01:03:00,872 --> 01:03:04,580
the true teaching, the heart of Nirvana,

871
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:09,792
of awakening, the true aspect of

872
01:03:09,816 --> 01:03:13,632
the formless, the ineffable stride of

873
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:16,986
the doctrine. It is not expressed

874
01:03:17,018 --> 01:03:20,234
by words, but especially transmitted beyond

875
01:03:20,282 --> 01:03:23,450
teaching. This teaching I now

876
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:27,098
give to Mahakashaba. And this is the same

877
01:03:27,154 --> 01:03:30,842
sort of answer that Tosan

878
01:03:30,906 --> 01:03:33,910
gave when he was asked, what is reality? He just said,

879
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:38,874
this flax weighs three pounds. An ordinary

880
01:03:38,922 --> 01:03:42,452
statement, just as holding up the flower is

881
01:03:42,476 --> 01:03:43,680
an ordinary action.

882
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:49,732
If I talk all the time and never listen to what

883
01:03:49,756 --> 01:03:52,852
others have to say, I shall lose touch with my

884
01:03:52,876 --> 01:03:56,160
fellow men. In the same way,

885
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,040
if I think all the time,

886
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:03,080
which is in a way talking to myself inwardly,

887
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:07,712
I shall lose touch with the reality with which words are

888
01:04:07,736 --> 01:04:10,340
about which they're intended to symbolize.

889
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,552
It is the fundamental insight of Zen that by an excess

890
01:04:15,616 --> 01:04:19,120
of thinking, men have lost touch with the real world in which they

891
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,248
live. The solution to this problem is

892
01:04:23,304 --> 01:04:26,912
to be silent in one's mind and to look again at the

893
01:04:26,936 --> 01:04:30,820
real world, not thinking, but seeing it directly.

894
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:34,374
This can't be talked about. If I want you to

895
01:04:34,382 --> 01:04:37,942
listen to music, any advice to do so will drown out the

896
01:04:37,966 --> 01:04:41,398
music. The directest way is to play the music

897
01:04:41,454 --> 01:04:42,170
itself.

898
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:49,530
You cannot put what it is into words.

899
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:54,854
And this, indeed, is a central point of

900
01:04:54,942 --> 01:04:58,290
Zen and of Buddhist understanding in general,

901
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:04,800
that reality is

902
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:05,940
beyond words.

903
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:12,208
And that one must not confuse the

904
01:05:12,264 --> 01:05:15,728
world of things as we think about them

905
01:05:15,784 --> 01:05:20,848
and talk about them and name them with

906
01:05:20,904 --> 01:05:23,420
the world as it actually is.

907
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:30,250
Because in the world of ideas and words and conceptions

908
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:32,750
and inherited social notions,

909
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:38,590
every one of us is perfectly convinced that he is a self, an ego.

910
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:45,050
But when we step out of that world of conventional

911
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:48,190
ideas into the clear daylight of reality,

912
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,600
and with wide open eyes look for ourselves,

913
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:55,920
what do we find?
