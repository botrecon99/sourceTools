1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,020
Isn't it true that swans are monogamous?

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,952
It's a very funny thing that when they begin to mate, they start fighting and

3
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:12,860
they don't know what it's all about. Then suddenly the fight turns into lovemaking.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,100
Underneath duality, there's unity.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,900
The Tweedledum and Tweedledee agreed to have a battle.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,790
So, you see, here's that weaving principle.

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,810
The things hold together by over, under, under, over,

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,110
over, under, under, over, over, under, under.

9
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,042
And that creates a stuff, it creates a

10
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:41,830
fabric, it creates clothing, it creates shelter,

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,550
creates what we call matter,

12
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,546
matter and

13
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:53,810
also the same word. Maya. Illusion.

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,030
See the world as a

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,678
marvelous illusion. We have

16
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:05,850
tried scientifically to understand the world

17
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,382
and explain its mysteries by

18
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:16,254
analyzing the smallest, smallest particles

19
00:01:16,302 --> 00:01:17,730
of things that exist,

20
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,484
inquiring down, down, down, what is this thing we call flesh

21
00:01:23,532 --> 00:01:26,748
or call steel or stone? What is it

22
00:01:26,804 --> 00:01:30,076
made of? Go down into the midst

23
00:01:30,108 --> 00:01:33,920
of it, and that's given us a certain understanding.

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,240
But only half of the understanding,

25
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,572
equally important, is not what

26
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:45,826
is the tiniest part, but in what

27
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,990
context is the tiniest particle.

28
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,002
You see, in. In relation to what is

29
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:59,522
it? Just as the word bark, as I

30
00:01:59,546 --> 00:02:02,470
showed you, has different meanings in different sentences.

31
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,930
So cells, molecules, atoms have

32
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,590
different properties in different contexts.

33
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:15,719
So what the scientist equally needs to study is

34
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:19,467
not simply what is anything when

35
00:02:19,603 --> 00:02:23,131
very, very minutely analyzed, but where

36
00:02:23,155 --> 00:02:26,971
is it? When is it that makes all

37
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:27,759
the difference?

38
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:33,559
Relativity isn't some kind of

39
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:38,130
slippery morass in

40
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,842
which all standards and all directions

41
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:46,110
get lost. Relativity is

42
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,270
really the soundest situation that there is.

43
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,750
See, it's the. It's the one supporting the other. It's this thing,

44
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,510
sharpness, teeth,

45
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,754
biting spines, crab shells,

46
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:08,186
all that kind of thing. You know, on the other side, it's the melting softness

47
00:03:08,218 --> 00:03:09,030
of life.

48
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,990
See, they go together just like that.

49
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,110
If you see that, if you. If you get that principle,

50
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,594
you can feel yourself not

51
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:29,936
sort of just rattling around in the world as a kind of somebody

52
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:33,792
who's been stuck down there, but you can

53
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:37,488
feel yourself

54
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:41,504
going on in

55
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:45,376
absolutely exact relationship with everything around

56
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:46,060
you.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,820
And this is very beautiful.

58
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:00,372
It isn't just that you are here looking

59
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:03,860
at what's out there like

60
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,520
you might be photographing it with your eyes.

61
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,680
It's that if that there wasn't there,

62
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,160
you wouldn't be here.

63
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,292
The outside thing that you see and the inside thing that

64
00:04:20,316 --> 00:04:23,773
you are are poles

65
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:28,269
of the same magnet or

66
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,289
back and front of the same coin.

67
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:35,769
And without one, there isn't the other.

68
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:42,621
That means, of course, then, that we are living in

69
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:46,969
the midst of a world of

70
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,030
animals, vegetables, minerals,

71
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,110
atmospheres,

72
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,874
astronomical bodies. That's highly

73
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:01,110
intelligent. It's intelligence

74
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,870
concentrated, crystallized in our brains.

75
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,914
That's where it comes out. You see, in any

76
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:14,402
field, let's take any field of forces, we take

77
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:18,322
a sort of chemical solution, and at certain critical

78
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:22,030
points in this chemical solution, the crystals start to form.

79
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,386
And so in the same way the total intelligence of this whole

80
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:30,070
universe crystallizes in human brains,

81
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,030
also in other kinds of brains.

82
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,750
That's where it really comes out.

83
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,322
But it's total intelligence of the whole field that

84
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:45,774
does this. So we

85
00:05:45,942 --> 00:05:49,770
go with the whole thing, interdependent with it.

86
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,494
We don't live in an environment which is just

87
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:59,102
rock, just air, just atmosphere

88
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,862
and so on. The environment's only like that when we

89
00:06:02,886 --> 00:06:06,542
think about it analytically and

90
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:10,670
try to explain it. But when we think of it

91
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,950
isn't just rock and air. See,

92
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,886
but those things go together. When you see

93
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:22,046
the interconnectedness, when you see in the simplest way how flowers

94
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:25,438
go with bees and other insects, they don't

95
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:29,422
live without them, humans go

96
00:06:29,446 --> 00:06:32,570
with cattle, they don't exist without them,

97
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,040
plants, et cetera, etc. Etc. Etc. When you see the intervals,

98
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,160
the significance of the relationships between these things,

99
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,808
it's only then when you see that, that you are

100
00:06:44,944 --> 00:06:47,020
aware of the melody.

101
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,584
Go back to the illustration I gave of the person who can't hear melody,

102
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:55,912
who's tone deaf. He hears only a succession of sounds because he's not

103
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:59,624
aware of the intervals. Now, most people are brought up to be tone

104
00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:03,610
deaf in respect to their own existence and the rest of the universe.

105
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,870
They don't see the relationships, they are not aware of the universe.

106
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,474
Once you spot that, you spot how everything

107
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:20,122
goes with the thing, that you are one end and that out there

108
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:23,750
is the other end, and they really go together,

109
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,230
then you may be said to be living a harmonious life.

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,368
When life gets busy, pause,

111
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:51,016
take a breath and reset your mind. Download mindset

112
00:07:51,048 --> 00:07:55,420
and listen to your favorite inspirational speeches to unlock your full potential.

113
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,694
The very idea of the future has something spurious

114
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:11,450
in it to live for. The future

115
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,930
is an indefinite postponement of life.

116
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,210
The great political systems of the Western world,

117
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,850
whether they be capitalist or communist,

118
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,198
are based on the notion

119
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:33,070
that what we live for is the future. It's always a five

120
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,190
year plan for something to turn up that will be better

121
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,822
than what we have now later on. Our notions of

122
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:43,070
the great Society are based on a

123
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,970
futurist approach to life, wherein you

124
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,464
go through in your education a whole series of steps.

125
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:54,728
The word in Latin, gradus, means a step.

126
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:58,344
So we have first grade, second grade, third grade, gratus,

127
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:02,328
gratis, gratis. Finally become a graduate. But you're

128
00:09:02,344 --> 00:09:05,640
still doing it. So that when you become

129
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,240
finally successful as the president of your

130
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,344
corporation, you have a funny feeling

131
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:14,300
of being cheated.

132
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,258
You climbed the stairway and you got to the top, and there's

133
00:09:20,274 --> 00:09:23,490
nowhere else to go. And since you've never

134
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,150
been taught to live in the present, you don't know how to.

135
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,490
So an insurance salesman comes around and

136
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,710
says, listen, I've got the very thing for you.

137
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,790
Retirement program. Because when you're 65,

138
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,906
you'll drop out of the system. And then you'll

139
00:09:41,938 --> 00:09:45,346
really be able to enjoy yourself despite your

140
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:49,250
prostate trouble, menopause, false teeth and

141
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,230
everything else.

142
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,082
So the art of living in the eternal now is not

143
00:09:56,106 --> 00:09:58,110
taught in our educational system.

144
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,738
And it's not taught because it's thought of as being feckless,

145
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:06,466
irresponsible. It isn't irresponsible at all.

146
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:10,530
It's. It is everybody's duty, I could put it that way.

147
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,570
To enjoy themselves.

148
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,490
Because if you don't do that, you become a nuisance,

149
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,502
you become aggressive, you become a robber, you become a thief.

150
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:26,422
You become somebody who's trying to organize

151
00:10:26,486 --> 00:10:29,782
the rest of the world. That is to say, a power maniac.

152
00:10:29,926 --> 00:10:33,462
Simply because you haven't learned the very simple,

153
00:10:33,526 --> 00:10:36,410
inexpensive art of living in the present moment.

154
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,574
It really doesn't take an awful lot of energy to

155
00:10:41,662 --> 00:10:43,490
maintain a human life.

156
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,646
If you really consider what you need to eat,

157
00:10:48,838 --> 00:10:51,958
what you need to wear, how much housing you have to have.

158
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:54,490
It comes down to something quite simple.

159
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,822
And the simpler, the more you have

160
00:10:58,846 --> 00:11:04,494
the capacity to enjoy watching

161
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:07,410
a raindrop crawl down a window.

162
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,646
But if you watch a raindrop crawl down a window and you think, my,

163
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:15,214
look at that, everybody says you're crazy.

164
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,622
You're watching a raindrop fall down a widow. Can't you find something more important to

165
00:11:18,646 --> 00:11:21,610
do? That means, can't you make more trouble than that?

166
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,622
So the mentality that doesn't recognize

167
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:32,530
the importance of watching a raindrop crawl down a window is

168
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,150
the one that is creating the trouble in the world today.

169
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,074
We say you are of no value. You're not even human unless

170
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,950
you're changing things, unless you're interfering, unless you're progressing.

171
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,794
We confuse growing with progressing. Unless something is happening

172
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:57,770
and great operation, a new project is going on and you're busy with

173
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,066
it. We say, well, you're, you, you're. You're lazy,

174
00:12:01,258 --> 00:12:05,594
you're good for nothing because you are not working

175
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:09,818
for the future. But they say if you're working

176
00:12:09,874 --> 00:12:11,710
for the future, you're quite mad.

177
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,950
So they don't work for the future.

178
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,914
And we say, well that's awful, that's irresponsible, you can't

179
00:12:19,962 --> 00:12:22,670
do that. That's not maintaining the world properly.

180
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,894
What do you think? Maybe that is maintaining the world properly.

181
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:30,462
Maybe it's we who think that everything should be

182
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:32,810
progressing who are destroying the world.

183
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,290
Of course we are,

184
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,850
by our Protestant ethic, by our notion

185
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,262
keeping everything in charge. It's true, we have a

186
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:48,974
great initial success. We destroy

187
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:52,330
diseases, we keep people alive.

188
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,734
But on the end is the H bomb, get rid of

189
00:12:57,742 --> 00:13:01,398
it all entirely. These non

190
00:13:01,454 --> 00:13:05,250
political people are saying to us,

191
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,970
the trouble with you is you don't know what you want.

192
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,210
You have a future which

193
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,826
you're working for, but you're all wretch

194
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:25,230
and no vomit. You promised yourselves

195
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,762
the good thing is going to happen. Keep promising, promising,

196
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:31,930
promising, promising. Even your money is a promise.

197
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,546
It says on the dollar bill that the treasury of the United

198
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:38,682
States will promise to pay a dollar. What are

199
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:41,670
you going to get if you deliver this and say, come on now,

200
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,320
I want whatever it is in this dollar.

201
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,980
And they just can give you credit because

202
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,964
it's paper, it's all symbolism. So the whole

203
00:13:55,012 --> 00:13:58,516
point is the future

204
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,880
is an illusion.

205
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,692
The basic ideas in Hindu cosmology that in the

206
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:10,470
course of time you go through the series of yugos

207
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,226
or the epochs, you begin

208
00:14:14,258 --> 00:14:17,490
with a great state of affairs and it gradually deteriorates.

209
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,882
Is a way of saying to people, in the

210
00:14:20,906 --> 00:14:23,990
course of time things only fall apart.

211
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,750
Therefore get out of time,

212
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,738
get off the wheel of samsara,

213
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:32,150
the rat race.

214
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,732
So this underlies my idea of what

215
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:41,280
I call the politics of diversion.

216
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,692
Divert Western man from history, from the

217
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:49,308
notion that he is in a historical process which is

218
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:53,100
leading to something always better and better and better, but which in fact only

219
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,960
leads to more and more destruction.

220
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,682
Divert people from time by

221
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:04,350
living a style of life which is timeless

222
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,970
and which is therefore more attractive than

223
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,710
life devoted to time.

224
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,562
People are hypnotized with money, which is

225
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:19,290
the symbol of wealth, as if it were something that was valuable in its own

226
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,790
right. People don't realize, in other words, that money

227
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,810
is bookkeeping, nothing but bookkeeping.

228
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,394
And therefore the whole idea of taxation, for example,

229
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:33,910
is a complete anachronism.

230
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,818
The thing that is stopping the flow of

231
00:15:38,874 --> 00:15:42,370
the actual wealth of the world is this fixation on

232
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,482
money. What you need to do is

233
00:15:46,586 --> 00:15:48,470
actually reverse taxation.

234
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,054
Instead of charging taxes, issue credit, but you

235
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:56,730
have to keep the credit balance to the gross national product

236
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,462
in some form of figuring. And then everybody can

237
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:01,930
circulate what they're making.

238
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,414
Otherwise, you're in this ridiculous situation where people are starving

239
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:10,110
in India and we are hoarding food supplies and

240
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,262
burning them and trying dumping them in the ocean, which is a

241
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:16,686
share insanity. But it's all based on a psychological block about

242
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:20,120
money. So this kind of

243
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,480
psychological block is what

244
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,728
an Indian philosophy would be called a Maya. It is an illusion.

245
00:16:26,824 --> 00:16:29,540
And it's the same kind of illusion as that of the future.

246
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,420
The idea that the future is when we are really going to live.

247
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,064
And if that's the way you operate when you get there, you're never going to

248
00:16:41,072 --> 00:16:44,244
be able to handle it because you still want a future ahead of you.

249
00:16:44,432 --> 00:16:48,012
You're a perpetual donkey with a carrot suspended

250
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:51,960
from your collar on a rod like this, and you're pursuing it.

251
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,822
Now, why talk about this? Is it

252
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:41,822
interesting? Is it important for the

253
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:45,310
human being to realize that

254
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,930
in some sense of the word, whatever it means,

255
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,970
he is God, or one with God?

256
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,170
A lot of people understand,

257
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,290
but so what?

258
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,340
Well, the importance of it is this.

259
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,544
That to know that you are God is another

260
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:13,544
way of saying that you feel completely with

261
00:18:13,632 --> 00:18:17,224
this universe. You feel profoundly

262
00:18:17,272 --> 00:18:20,600
rooted in it and connected with it. You feel,

263
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,700
in other words, that the whole energy which expresses itself in the galaxies

264
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,970
is intimate. It is not

265
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,442
something to which you are a stranger, but it

266
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:36,834
is that with which you, whatever that is, are intimately

267
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:40,162
bound up. That in your seeing, your hearing,

268
00:18:40,226 --> 00:18:44,290
your talking, your thinking you're moving, you express that

269
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,950
which it is, which moves the sun and other stars.

270
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,396
And if you don't know that, if you don't

271
00:18:54,428 --> 00:18:57,680
feel that, well, naturally you feel alien.

272
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,320
You feel a stranger in the world.

273
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,200
And if you feel a stranger, you feel hostile.

274
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,564
And therefore you start to bulldoze things about to beat

275
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:12,668
it up and to try and make the world

276
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:16,160
submit to your will. And you become a real troublemaker.

277
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:23,510
So I feel also one reason why you become hostile

278
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,450
is that feeling that you were just brought into this place,

279
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,126
that your father and mother went up to some monkey business that they probably

280
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:36,054
shouldn't have done, or it was bad rubber goods. And as a result of this,

281
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:39,254
here you are and you didn't ask to be here. Well, you always feel you

282
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:42,650
can turn around and blame them. You can blame somebody,

283
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,352
you can blame the government, you can blame the rascals, you can blame the

284
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:51,664
cheaters. Always supposing you yourself aren't a

285
00:19:51,672 --> 00:19:53,860
rascal, which is long odds.

286
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,728
You always can blame someone and say, I Didn't ask

287
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:01,260
for it, take it away.

288
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,240
And yet, and yet, and yet very few people

289
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,220
are all too ready to take it away.

290
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,962
And if you don't, if you

291
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:20,430
don't say take it away,

292
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,430
what are you going to do?

293
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,430
You've really got to assume responsibility for it.

294
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,140
You've got to say yes to

295
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,200
what happens.

296
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,170
A lot of people don't know how we got the Bible at all.

297
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,566
We Westerners got the Bible thanks to the Catholic

298
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:31,052
Church and they took over

299
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:34,940
the books of the Old Testament, which even by the time of Christ had not

300
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,204
been finally decided upon by the Jews. The Jews

301
00:21:38,252 --> 00:21:42,316
did not close the canon of the Old Testament until the year 100

302
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:45,564
AD or thereabouts at the Synod of Jamnia.

303
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:48,972
And then they finally decided which were the canonical books of

304
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:52,396
the Hebrew Scriptures and embodied them in the Masoretic

305
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:55,702
text, the earliest copy of which dates from the

306
00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:58,850
10th century, early in the 10th century AD.

307
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,654
The books to be included in the New Testament were not finally decided

308
00:22:05,702 --> 00:22:09,970
upon until the year 382

309
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:15,850
AD again at the Synod of Rome under Pope Damasus.

310
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:21,290
So it was the Church, the Catholic Church, that promulgated the Bible

311
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,070
and said, we are giving you these scriptures on

312
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,542
our authority and by the authority of

313
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:32,774
the informal tradition that has existed among us from the

314
00:22:32,782 --> 00:22:35,050
beginning, inspired by the Holy Spirit.

315
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:40,294
So you receive historically the Bible on the Church's

316
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:44,294
say so. And the Catholic Church insists

317
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:48,768
therefore, that the Church, collectively speaking

318
00:22:48,944 --> 00:22:51,540
under the presumed guidance of the Holy Spirit,

319
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,140
has the authority to interpret the Bible.

320
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,980
And you can take that or leave it.

321
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,016
Hindus believe that the Vedas are divinely

322
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:07,680
revealed and inspired with just as much fervor as any Christian or any

323
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,960
Jew. Muslims believe that the Quran is

324
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,226
divinely inspired. And some Buddhists believe

325
00:23:14,378 --> 00:23:17,842
that their sutras are also of divine,

326
00:23:17,906 --> 00:23:21,110
or rather a Buddhic origin.

327
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,826
The Japanese believe that the ancient texts

328
00:23:25,858 --> 00:23:28,834
of Shinto are likewise of divine origin.

329
00:23:28,882 --> 00:23:30,550
And who is to be judge?

330
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:36,550
So if the Church says the Bible is true,

331
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,294
it finally comes down to you. Are you going to believe the church

332
00:23:42,342 --> 00:23:46,182
or aren't you? So really,

333
00:23:46,366 --> 00:23:50,214
I won't deny anybody's right to hold these opinions.

334
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:54,262
You may indeed believe that the Bible is literally true

335
00:23:54,406 --> 00:23:57,750
and that it was actually dictated by God to

336
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:00,410
Moses and the prophets and the apostles.

337
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:06,278
That may be your opinion and you are at liberty to hold it. I don't

338
00:24:06,294 --> 00:24:09,708
agree with you. I do believe,

339
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:13,276
on the other hand, that there is a sense in which the Bible is divinely

340
00:24:13,308 --> 00:24:14,160
inspired.

341
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,868
But since inspiration

342
00:24:19,964 --> 00:24:22,880
always comes through a human vehicle,

343
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,580
it is liable to be distorted by that vehicle,

344
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,680
in other words, I'm talking to you through a sound system.

345
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,480
And it's the only one now available.

346
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:37,270
Now, if there's something wrong with this sound system,

347
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:42,830
whatever truths I might utter to you will be distorted, my voice will be distorted,

348
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,710
and you might mistake the meaning of what I said.

349
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,858
Now, so therefore, everybody who receives divine inspiration,

350
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,590
and I'm using that in a very loose way,

351
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:00,760
but anybody who receives it will express it within

352
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,940
the limits of what language he knows.

353
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,912
And by language here, I don't only mean English,

354
00:25:07,976 --> 00:25:10,540
Latin, Greek, Hebrew or Sanskrit.

355
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,392
I mean language in the sense of what sort of terms

356
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:18,260
are available to you. What kind of religion were you brought up with?

357
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,820
My opinion is the Jesus of Nazareth

358
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:28,490
was a human being, like Buddha,

359
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:32,854
like Sri Ramakrishna, like Ramana Maharshi,

360
00:25:32,982 --> 00:25:36,998
etc, who early

361
00:25:37,054 --> 00:25:41,062
in life had a colossal experience of what we call cosmic

362
00:25:41,126 --> 00:25:44,694
consciousness. Now, you don't have to be any particular

363
00:25:44,782 --> 00:25:48,342
kind of religion to get this experience. It can hit anyone

364
00:25:48,406 --> 00:25:51,956
anytime, like falling in love in greater

365
00:25:51,988 --> 00:25:55,520
or lesser degree, but it's found all over the world.

366
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,908
And when it hits you, you know it. Sometimes it comes

367
00:25:59,964 --> 00:26:03,560
after long practice of meditations and spiritual discipline.

368
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,252
Sometimes it comes for no reason that anybody can determine.

369
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:11,684
We say it's the grace of God, that there comes this overwhelming

370
00:26:11,732 --> 00:26:15,400
conviction that you have mistaken your identity,

371
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:20,078
that what you thought, what I thought was just old Alan

372
00:26:20,094 --> 00:26:23,810
Watts, was only completely superficial.

373
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,062
So you can very well understand how people to

374
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,694
whom this happens feel genuinely

375
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:35,406
inspired because very often there goes

376
00:26:35,438 --> 00:26:39,998
along with it an extremely warm feeling because

377
00:26:40,134 --> 00:26:44,024
you see the divine in everybody else's

378
00:26:44,072 --> 00:26:47,064
eyes. When Kabir,

379
00:26:47,192 --> 00:26:49,980
a great Hindu Muslim mystic,

380
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,008
was a very old man, he used to look around at people

381
00:26:54,144 --> 00:26:56,700
and say, to whom shall I preach?

382
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,700
Because he saw the beloved in all eyes.

383
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,060
The traditions of Asia,

384
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,834
Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist and so forth, are full of miraculous

385
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:16,150
stories. And we take them in our stride.

386
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:22,482
We don't think that there are any sign of anything in particular except

387
00:27:22,546 --> 00:27:26,386
psychic power. And I'm really a little scared

388
00:27:26,498 --> 00:27:30,018
of the growing interest in psychic power, because that's

389
00:27:30,034 --> 00:27:31,830
what I call psycho technics.

390
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:36,402
And we've made such a mess of things with ordinary techniques that

391
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:40,570
heaven only knows what we might do if we got hold of psycho technics

392
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,934
and started raising people from the dead and prolonging life

393
00:27:45,022 --> 00:27:48,838
insufferably in. The whole answer to the story of miracles

394
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:50,970
is simply imagine that you're God.

395
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,570
Now, what happened?

396
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,530
The apostles didn't quite get the point.

397
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,260
They were awed by the miracles of Jesus.

398
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,060
They worshiped him as people do Worship gurus.

399
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,232
And it's, you know, to what lengths that can go if you've been

400
00:28:17,256 --> 00:28:20,240
around guru land. And so the Christian said,

401
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,776
okay, okay, Jesus of Nazareth was the son

402
00:28:23,808 --> 00:28:27,220
of God, but let it stop right there. Nobody else.

403
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,140
So what happened was that Jesus was pedestalized.

404
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,920
He was put in a position that was safely upstairs

405
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,548
so that his troublesome experience of cosmic consciousness would

406
00:28:41,604 --> 00:28:45,440
not come and cause other people to be a nuisance.

407
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,612
And those who have had this experience and expressed it during

408
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:56,220
those times when the Church had political power were almost invariably

409
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,538
persecuted. Guardiano Bruno was burnt

410
00:28:59,554 --> 00:29:03,042
at the stake. John Scotus original was excommunicated.

411
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:06,610
Meister Eckhart's theses were condemned, and so

412
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,658
on and so on. A few mystics got away with it because

413
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:12,470
they used cautious language.

414
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:19,590
But you see what happens if you pedestalize Jesus.

415
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,054
You strangle the gospel at birth. And it has been the tradition

416
00:29:25,102 --> 00:29:28,670
in both the Catholic Church and

417
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,270
in Protestantism to

418
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:37,262
pass off what I will call an

419
00:29:37,286 --> 00:29:38,850
emasculated gospel.

420
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:44,862
Gospel means good news. And I cannot for

421
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:48,494
the life of me think what is the good news about. The gospel is ordinarily

422
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:51,830
handed down. Here is the revelation of God in Christ,

423
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:55,850
in Jesus. And we are supposed to follow his life

424
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:59,434
and example without having the unique

425
00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:01,630
advantage of being the boss's son,

426
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,586
born of a virgin, knowing he is the son

427
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:09,710
of God, having the power of miracles,

428
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:13,706
knowing that basically it's impossible to kill him, that he's going to rise

429
00:30:13,738 --> 00:30:17,028
again in the end. And we are asked to take up our cross and follow

430
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:20,960
him, when we don't know that about ourselves at all.

431
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,428
So what happens is this. We are delivered,

432
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:29,320
therefore, a gospel which is in fact an impossible religion.

433
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,240
It's impossible to follow the way of Christ.

434
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,480
Many a Christian has admitted it.

435
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,838
I am a miserable sinner. I fall far

436
00:30:41,894 --> 00:30:45,854
short of the example of Christ. But do you realize

437
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:48,810
the more you say that, the better you are.

438
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:54,718
Because what happened was that Christianity institutionalized

439
00:30:54,814 --> 00:30:58,850
guilt as a virtue. And therefore

440
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:02,130
you will always be aware of your shortcomings.

441
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,214
And so the more shortcomings you feel, the more. In other words,

442
00:31:07,262 --> 00:31:11,120
you are aware of the vast abyss between Christ and yourself.

443
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,196
So you go to confession, and if you've

444
00:31:15,228 --> 00:31:17,760
got a nice, dear understanding confessor,

445
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,560
you'll say, my child, you know you've sinned very grievously,

446
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,600
but you must realize that the love of God and of our Lord is infinite

447
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,240
and that naturally you are forgiven.

448
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,332
And you know you've committed a murder and robbed a bank and fornicated

449
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:40,600
around and so on. The Priest is perfectly patient and quiet.

450
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,604
Well, you feel awful to the love of God. I've wounded Jesus,

451
00:31:45,732 --> 00:31:47,920
grieved the Holy Spirit and so on.

452
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,068
But you know in the back of your mind you're going to do it all

453
00:31:52,124 --> 00:31:55,640
over again. You won't be able to help yourself.

454
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,876
You'll try, but there's

455
00:31:59,908 --> 00:32:03,640
always a greater and greater sense of guilt.

456
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,490
This is the Christianity of most people.

457
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,846
Now there is a much more subtle Christianity of the theologians,

458
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:15,286
the mystics and the philosophers. But it's not what gets

459
00:32:15,318 --> 00:32:18,742
preached from the pulpit. What would

460
00:32:18,766 --> 00:32:22,610
the real gospel be? The real good news

461
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,886
is not simply that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son

462
00:32:26,918 --> 00:32:29,836
of God,

463
00:32:29,998 --> 00:32:33,968
but that he was a

464
00:32:34,024 --> 00:32:37,120
powerful son of God who came

465
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,448
to open everybody's eyes to the fact that you are

466
00:32:40,504 --> 00:32:41,100
too.

467
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,496
And this is perfectly plain. If you will

468
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:50,940
go to the tenth chapter of St. John,

469
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,992
verse 30, there is

470
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:58,302
the passage where Jesus says, I and the

471
00:32:58,326 --> 00:33:01,822
Father are one. There are some people who are not

472
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:05,342
intimate disciples around, and they're horrified and they immediately pick

473
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:06,970
up stones to stone him.

474
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,534
He says, many good works I have shown you from the Father,

475
00:33:11,662 --> 00:33:13,930
and for which of these do you stone me?

476
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,742
And they said, for a good work we stone you not, but for blasphemy,

477
00:33:17,806 --> 00:33:21,470
because you, being a man, make yourself God. And he

478
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,990
replied, isn't it written in your law, I have said you are

479
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,650
gods?

480
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:32,230
He's quoting the 82nd Psalm.

481
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:37,350
Is it not written in your law, I have said you are gods.

482
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:42,098
If God called them those to whom he gave his word,

483
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:44,870
gods. And you can't deny the Scriptures.

484
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,346
How can you say I blaspheme because

485
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:52,310
I said I am a son of God?

486
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,310
Well, there's the whole thing in a nutshell.

487
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,350
Because if you read the King James Bible that descended with the angel,

488
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,714
you will see in italics in front of these words,

489
00:34:05,762 --> 00:34:08,866
son of God. The Son of God. Because I said I am

490
00:34:08,938 --> 00:34:13,010
the Son of God. And most people think that the italics are for emphasis.

491
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:17,074
They're not. The italics indicate words interpolated

492
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:20,732
by the translators. You will

493
00:34:20,756 --> 00:34:24,080
not find that in the Greek. The Greek says a son of God.

494
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,708
So it seems to me here perfectly plain that

495
00:34:31,764 --> 00:34:35,436
Jesus is. Got it in the back of his mind that this isn't

496
00:34:35,468 --> 00:34:39,260
something peculiar to himself. So when

497
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,988
he says I am the way, no man

498
00:34:43,044 --> 00:34:46,398
comes to the Father but by me. This I

499
00:34:46,454 --> 00:34:49,822
am. This me is the divine

500
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:53,502
in us, which in Hebrew would

501
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:55,970
be called the ruach Adonai.

502
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:01,198
So the point is that the ruach is the

503
00:35:01,254 --> 00:35:05,230
divine in the creature by

504
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,814
virtue of which we are sons of or of the nature

505
00:35:08,862 --> 00:35:13,108
of God, manifestations of the divine. This discovery

506
00:35:13,204 --> 00:35:15,360
is the gospel that is the good news.

507
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,080
But this has been perpetually repressed

508
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,680
throughout the history of Western religion,

509
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,100
because all Western religions have taken the

510
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,680
form of celestial monarchies.

511
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,480
Which is not the religion of Jesus,

512
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,274
which was the realization of divine sonship, but the religion

513
00:35:43,322 --> 00:35:47,066
about Jesus which pedestalizes

514
00:35:47,098 --> 00:35:50,762
him and which says only this man of all the

515
00:35:50,786 --> 00:35:54,390
sons of woman was divine. And you had better recognize it

516
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,590
utterly exclusive,

517
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,322
convinced in advance of examining the doctrines of

518
00:36:03,346 --> 00:36:06,190
any other religion that it is the top religion.

519
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,470
And so it becomes a freak religion,

520
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:17,550
just as it has made a freak of Jesus an unnatural man.

521
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,562
It claims uniqueness, not realizing

522
00:36:24,706 --> 00:36:28,470
that what it does teach would be far more credible

523
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,840
if it were truly Catholic. That is to say,

524
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,132
restated again the truths which have

525
00:36:37,156 --> 00:36:40,988
been known from time immemorial, which have appeared

526
00:36:41,084 --> 00:36:43,320
in all the great cultures of the world.

527
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,884
If then we can see this, that Jesus

528
00:36:49,932 --> 00:36:53,980
speaks not from the situation of

529
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,372
a historical deus ex

530
00:36:57,396 --> 00:37:01,214
machina, a kind of weird extraordinary

531
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:05,198
event, but he is a voice which

532
00:37:05,254 --> 00:37:09,038
joins with other voices that have said in every

533
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:12,330
place and time, wake up, man, wake up

534
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,410
and realize who you are.

535
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,190
No scolding, no rational demonstration

536
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:25,530
of the right way to behave is going to inspire people with love.

537
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,560
Something else must happen.

538
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,644
I feel then you see that it's enormously important that churches

539
00:37:33,692 --> 00:37:37,880
stop being talking shops. They become

540
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,996
centers of contemplation. What is contemplation?

541
00:37:42,108 --> 00:37:45,676
Contemplum. It's what you do in the temple. You don't

542
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:49,500
come to the temple to chatter, but to be

543
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,560
still and know that I am God.

544
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,904
And this is why, if the Christian

545
00:37:57,952 --> 00:38:01,072
religion, if the gospel of Christ is to mean

546
00:38:01,096 --> 00:38:04,896
anything at all, instead of just being one of the forgotten religions

547
00:38:05,008 --> 00:38:08,660
along with Osiris and Mithra,

548
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,220
we must see Christ as the great mystic,

549
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,780
in the proper sense of the word mystic, not someone who

550
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,672
has all sorts of magical powers and understands spirits and

551
00:38:22,696 --> 00:38:26,352
so on. A mystic, strictly speaking, is one who realizes

552
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:29,340
union with God by whatever name.

553
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,180
This seems to me the crux and message of the Gospel,

554
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,312
summed up in the prayer of Jesus, which St. John records as

555
00:38:39,336 --> 00:38:42,800
he speaks over his disciples, praying that they may

556
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,586
be one. He even as you, Father, and I are one,

557
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,550
that they may be all one.

558
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:53,590
All realize this

559
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:57,710
divine sonship, or oneness,

560
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,674
basic identity with the eternal energy of

561
00:39:01,682 --> 00:39:05,050
the universe and the love that moves the sun

562
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,270
and other stars.

563
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:17,876
You become aware vividly of the fact that

564
00:39:17,948 --> 00:39:21,720
you as a an individual

565
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:27,380
imply by your existence everything else that

566
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:31,140
exists or

567
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,560
ever has existed or ever will exist.

568
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,640
You can't exist as the kind of person you are without all that.

569
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,892
Now that's the secret to the connection between you and the

570
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:50,428
cosmos. Just as a back doesn't exist without

571
00:39:50,484 --> 00:39:53,996
a front in just that sort

572
00:39:54,028 --> 00:39:57,372
of way, all of it doesn't exist without you,

573
00:39:57,556 --> 00:40:00,040
and you don't exist without all of it.

574
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:09,958
Welcome to the Alan Watts Being in the Way podcast. I'm your host

575
00:40:10,014 --> 00:40:13,174
Mark Watts, and today and in the coming weeks, we're going to

576
00:40:13,182 --> 00:40:16,774
bring something special to you, which is some of my father's radio talks from

577
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:19,990
the 90s. Being in a half hour format, these radio

578
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,302
programs are a little shorter than what we've been doing in the past. And so

579
00:40:23,326 --> 00:40:26,102
even though you may be spending a little bit less time with us, I hope

580
00:40:26,126 --> 00:40:30,734
that you'll enjoy the program and seek out our other offerings@AlanWatts.org

581
00:40:30,822 --> 00:40:34,350
where you'll find a variety of selections, including offerings from our new

582
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,494
streaming channel. You'll also find the podcast there and a variety of

583
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,550
other offerings, including biographic material about

584
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:45,710
my father and his rich legacy. Our podcast today

585
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:52,878
is out of The Trap, Part 2 this

586
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:57,220
morning I was discussing the

587
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,340
two great myths which underlie

588
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,380
Western man's sense of identity.

589
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,120
The Judeo Christian myth of

590
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,912
a universe founded upon the personal

591
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:18,300
decision of a cosmic king, whose image,

592
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,878
however gracious and loving it may be in certain aspects,

593
00:41:23,024 --> 00:41:26,830
is historically founded on the great

594
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:30,066
monarchs of the ancient near east,

595
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:34,430
on people like Hammurabi and

596
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:39,122
Amenhotep iv, and in

597
00:41:39,146 --> 00:41:40,950
their turn, David and Solomon.

598
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:46,830
Also be it said, on the image of Cyrus who

599
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:51,970
liberated the Hebrews from their captivity in

600
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,630
the Babylonian empire.

601
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:59,430
And the very word Cyrus, of course, is the Greek word for Lord.

602
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:04,470
Kyrie, Kyrios. So Kyrie eleison.

603
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:08,882
The question is, are we worshiping Cyrus or the Lord of

604
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:09,830
the universe?

605
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:16,034
Now I pointed out that this mythology became

606
00:42:16,082 --> 00:42:20,154
intolerable to Western man because it was

607
00:42:20,242 --> 00:42:23,470
a conception of the universe that was just too damn intelligent.

608
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:27,482
It was the whole thing was peeking on

609
00:42:27,506 --> 00:42:31,322
you. And so it was very comfortable

610
00:42:31,386 --> 00:42:35,146
to be able to exchange this mythology for a conception

611
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:38,750
of the universe as being purely mechanical, stupid and empty.

612
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:43,004
Only you paid for that. The price of knowing that you were futile,

613
00:42:43,122 --> 00:42:46,792
that you too were a machine. But some people would rather a

614
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:50,712
dead universe than a living one, with standards of

615
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:52,940
righteousness that were a little bit oppressive.

616
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,912
But the point I wanted to make is that the

617
00:42:58,016 --> 00:43:01,336
latter story about the world is just as much of a myth

618
00:43:01,368 --> 00:43:04,968
as the former one. Although this conception

619
00:43:04,984 --> 00:43:08,526
of the Newtonian universe, this mechanical trap, is,

620
00:43:08,568 --> 00:43:12,162
is plausible Today this is merely a

621
00:43:12,186 --> 00:43:15,650
matter of fashion. And so what we saw was

622
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,818
this. You can talk

623
00:43:18,874 --> 00:43:22,482
the universe down by describing everything intelligent in

624
00:43:22,506 --> 00:43:25,842
it as a special form of unintelligence. On the other hand,

625
00:43:25,866 --> 00:43:29,794
you can talk it up by saying that all unintelligent

626
00:43:29,842 --> 00:43:33,330
things are merely special forms of intelligence,

627
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:37,220
say rather low grade forms of intelligence, intelligence, but intelligent nonetheless.

628
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,612
And that is a more complementary view to things than the

629
00:43:40,636 --> 00:43:43,684
other one. And I was suggesting that it's, on the whole

630
00:43:43,732 --> 00:43:47,476
better policy to pay compliments to life than to give it insults.

631
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:51,060
As the proverb says, you don't catch flies except with

632
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,628
honey. And after

633
00:43:54,684 --> 00:43:59,332
all, if things do manage to exist and

634
00:43:59,356 --> 00:44:02,960
to go along, the view which

635
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,352
has the positive edge to it is likely to be

636
00:44:06,376 --> 00:44:08,420
better than the one that has the negative edge.

637
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,320
Not because I'm trying to be some sort of Pollyanna person or silly optimist,

638
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,952
but simply because in

639
00:44:19,976 --> 00:44:23,152
the interchange, or you might call it conflict,

640
00:44:23,216 --> 00:44:26,260
game between the various pairs of opposites,

641
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:30,350
although the snake has the best lines,

642
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:37,990
the dove wins out in the end because

643
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:42,602
the dove does it just

644
00:44:42,626 --> 00:44:46,570
a little bit more. You see what I mean? In, for example, in the system

645
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:50,122
of Hindu cosmology, the period of

646
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:54,768
manifestation is divided into four yugas, four epochs,

647
00:44:54,944 --> 00:44:58,220
and they differ in length. The best one comes first,

648
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,560
that's the longest, and everything is just splendid. Then there comes

649
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,032
a second epoch that's not so good. It's got

650
00:45:06,056 --> 00:45:09,792
a little. It's a bit off balance, and that lasts pretty long, but not as

651
00:45:09,816 --> 00:45:13,296
long as the first one. Then there comes another epoch in which the powers

652
00:45:13,328 --> 00:45:16,656
of good and evil are equally balanced and that lasts still

653
00:45:16,728 --> 00:45:20,422
shorter. Finally comes the so called Kali Yuga,

654
00:45:20,616 --> 00:45:23,706
which is the worst one, when evil is triumphant and the whole

655
00:45:23,738 --> 00:45:27,434
world blows up at the end, and that's the shortest. So you see,

656
00:45:27,522 --> 00:45:30,794
for exactly 2/3 of the time, if you figure it

657
00:45:30,802 --> 00:45:34,442
all out, the positive forces are in operation,

658
00:45:34,586 --> 00:45:37,754
but the negative ones have their innings because it goes off with such a big

659
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:38,950
bang at the end.

660
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:44,714
So this is the way the world ends, not with a whimper, but with a

661
00:45:44,722 --> 00:45:47,320
bang, according to this cosmology.

662
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:52,404
And furthermore, a thing to console you is that time goes faster

663
00:45:52,452 --> 00:45:56,132
in the Kali Yuga than in the other Yugas. And in

664
00:45:56,156 --> 00:45:59,956
the end, you see, the destruction is personified as Shiva,

665
00:46:00,068 --> 00:46:04,100
who just dances the dance of the Tandava

666
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,972
with all his 10 arms waving with knives and clubs and lightning and everything.

667
00:46:08,076 --> 00:46:11,120
And the whole thing blows up. But the instant it blows up,

668
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:17,210
everybody wakes up, finds out who they are

669
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:22,610
and laughs. It's silly because What a terror and how easily overcome.

670
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:28,850
Now that, of course, again, I'm speaking mythological language.

671
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:34,254
And it is important to realize this because mythological

672
00:46:34,302 --> 00:46:37,352
language is useful. You can

673
00:46:37,376 --> 00:46:39,820
say things with it you can't say in other ways.

674
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,860
And often mythological ideas are more sophisticated

675
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,500
than what you might call abstract or even scientific ideas.

676
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,100
You see, if you think of the universe as founded on

677
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,260
Brahma or someone like that, even Jehovah,

678
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,340
you've got definitely an anthropomorphic idea of the Lord.

679
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,712
He's the, the old gentleman or he's the great dancer,

680
00:47:10,856 --> 00:47:12,660
whichever image you want to use.

681
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,260
And you might say this is rather primitive. Yes, it is primitive,

682
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,640
but there, there isn't really a better image. If you

683
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,512
think of it as, say, to use Northrop's

684
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:29,340
inimitable phrase, the undifferentiated aesthetic continuum.

685
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:35,650
What you've got is a conception vaguely resembling tapioca or

686
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:39,842
some kind of goo. And that is really an inferior

687
00:47:39,906 --> 00:47:42,550
conception to the human image.

688
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:47,874
Alas, you see, we don't know anything more evolved than the human image.

689
00:47:48,002 --> 00:47:51,154
You may have had some of you conversations with angels

690
00:47:51,282 --> 00:47:55,154
or with the, the ultimate itself. And when you do meet the ultimate itself itself,

691
00:47:55,202 --> 00:47:58,670
as some of you have, you know that

692
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:03,042
you can't think about it, but it's certainly not

693
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:05,810
a minus quantity. It's certainly nothing like goo,

694
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:08,470
just plain undifferentiated goo.

695
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:14,310
So the, the advantage of mythological ideas

696
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:18,950
is that you know they're mythological and therefore you don't take them literally.

697
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,468
That's a very important thing to remember. So don't

698
00:48:25,484 --> 00:48:29,276
worry about people who believe in God. The problem

699
00:48:29,348 --> 00:48:34,124
about believing in God, incidentally, is that

700
00:48:34,292 --> 00:48:38,332
believing is the wrong attitude. Believing is a

701
00:48:38,356 --> 00:48:42,440
form of mistrust because it's saying,

702
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,920
I fervently wish that you exist,

703
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:50,982
and if you don't, I don't know what to do with myself. Now the,

704
00:48:51,086 --> 00:48:53,910
the real attitude of faith is not believing,

705
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:57,090
but simply being open to whatever reality is.

706
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:02,134
And to say you don't know. That's why even in early Christianity,

707
00:49:02,182 --> 00:49:06,182
you find out that they call the highest form of faith

708
00:49:06,326 --> 00:49:10,422
unknowing agnosia in Greek, from which we

709
00:49:10,446 --> 00:49:13,726
get, in its kind of deprived sense, the word

710
00:49:13,758 --> 00:49:16,430
agnostic. But agnosia,

711
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:19,550
unknowing is the highest form of faith because ultimately, of course,

712
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:23,022
what is the, the, the final witch than which there is no

713
00:49:23,046 --> 00:49:26,942
witcher, wouldn't completely know itself what it

714
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:30,222
was, because in order to know what something is,

715
00:49:30,246 --> 00:49:33,342
you have to be able to classify it and you have to compare it with

716
00:49:33,366 --> 00:49:36,734
something it isn't. And so the final Ground of the universe

717
00:49:36,782 --> 00:49:40,302
is perfectly unclassifiable, therefore, strictly speaking,

718
00:49:40,366 --> 00:49:44,210
outside the domain of logic and formal philosophy.

719
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:50,570
Now, having examined them, these two

720
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:54,398
mythological forms which underlie

721
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,678
the Western man's intense

722
00:49:57,854 --> 00:50:00,530
feeling of alienation and separateness,

723
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:03,850
we have to go into another dimension of the question,

724
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,280
and that is the influence upon who we think we

725
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,860
are of our social institutions.

726
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,820
Now, what is a social institution?

727
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,280
We know that there are things like the

728
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,180
family, marriage,

729
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,340
the police, the courts,

730
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:33,362
the law, the church. And we know that

731
00:50:33,386 --> 00:50:36,866
these are social institutions. But social

732
00:50:36,938 --> 00:50:39,790
institutions are far more subtle than those things.

733
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:47,426
Time, for example, is a social institution because

734
00:50:47,498 --> 00:50:52,114
it is a matter of convention, that is to say, of coming together to agree

735
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:55,704
to measure time in a certain way,

736
00:50:55,762 --> 00:50:59,180
way. And we have international agreement about

737
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:03,212
that. Likewise, obviously, money is

738
00:51:03,236 --> 00:51:06,652
a social institution. So are

739
00:51:06,676 --> 00:51:07,920
weights and measures.

740
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,400
So are ideas of value.

741
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,460
What is the good life? Who is contributing to

742
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,240
society and who is working against it.

743
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:25,764
So, you see, we were discussing this morning, among other things,

744
00:51:25,932 --> 00:51:27,880
excuse me, the idea of survival.

745
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:33,540
And that survival is a good thing and

746
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:37,220
to survive as long as possible is a very good thing. But that is

747
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,400
a form of social institution.

748
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,680
It is something we have come to agree about.

749
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:47,790
It isn't necessarily true in

750
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:50,410
the sense that, shall I say,

751
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:56,542
the French language is not a truer language

752
00:51:56,606 --> 00:51:57,650
than the English.

753
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:03,742
But so long as people agree to speak a certain language,

754
00:52:03,806 --> 00:52:07,502
they can communicate. And they've decided that communication is

755
00:52:07,526 --> 00:52:11,822
a good thing. So any language that makes communication

756
00:52:11,886 --> 00:52:13,890
possible is a good language.

757
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:18,490
And in a way, the more people who agree about it, the better.

758
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:22,974
But it is a matter of agreement, you see.

759
00:52:23,062 --> 00:52:26,450
Same way the lines of latitude and longitude are conventions.

760
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:31,006
They are. They don't exist. You can't tie

761
00:52:31,038 --> 00:52:34,494
up packages with the equator. But it's a

762
00:52:34,502 --> 00:52:37,950
very useful idea. And so, in the same

763
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:42,422
way, the ways in which we have shaped the constellations that

764
00:52:42,446 --> 00:52:45,910
we all agree that the stars called the Big Dipper look something

765
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:49,526
like a dipper. And though,

766
00:52:49,598 --> 00:52:52,130
you know, there aren't any strings tying them together,

767
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:56,010
the constellation is not there as a constellation.

768
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:02,550
So, in a sense, we project our institutions

769
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:06,904
onto the world in rather the same way that psychiatric

770
00:53:06,952 --> 00:53:10,140
patients project images onto a Rorschach blot.

771
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,896
And what interests the psychiatrist is what sort of images this person

772
00:53:13,968 --> 00:53:17,352
produces that tells him something about the person. In the

773
00:53:17,376 --> 00:53:20,820
same way our social institutions tell us something about people.

774
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,568
And furthermore, as I also explained this morning,

775
00:53:24,704 --> 00:53:28,500
people are also members of the external world.

776
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,940
And therefore they tell us something about the external world.

777
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:39,090
Man is something nature is doing and

778
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:42,402
is not a stranger, as these two Great myths have

779
00:53:42,426 --> 00:53:45,922
made us believe so.

780
00:53:45,946 --> 00:53:50,590
It's the. The physical facts of the matter are not

781
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:56,070
that we are confronted with note that word confront

782
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:00,684
with a world that cares nothing for us and that

783
00:54:00,852 --> 00:54:05,200
has nothing in common with our kind and style of intelligence.

784
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:11,020
It is rather the very opposite that

785
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:15,292
the fact that we are intelligent is symptomatic

786
00:54:15,436 --> 00:54:17,840
of the intelligence of the world as a whole.

787
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,040
We live in a highly intelligent environment.

788
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,582
And intelligence, you see, is really a

789
00:54:27,606 --> 00:54:29,810
kind of complex behavior.

790
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:34,926
When we see some very exquisite

791
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:38,366
pattern, we look at it and say,

792
00:54:38,518 --> 00:54:42,206
my, isn't that wonderful? Isn't that intelligent

793
00:54:42,238 --> 00:54:46,142
looking? I wonder who did it. Because we associate

794
00:54:46,206 --> 00:54:47,930
all intelligence with a who.

795
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:53,890
And when you look at a plant, it's obviously intelligent.

796
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:58,610
Its shape, its rhythm,

797
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:03,310
all its wonderful tubes inside. Its complex relationship to

798
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:07,182
bees and birds and to the surrounding

799
00:55:07,246 --> 00:55:10,686
atmosphere and light. This is a very intelligent

800
00:55:10,718 --> 00:55:14,430
affair. Now, in. In just the same way

801
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:18,708
we are related to the external world as

802
00:55:18,764 --> 00:55:22,772
plants are, in amazingly complicated

803
00:55:22,836 --> 00:55:25,920
ways. And by and large, we don't notice them.

804
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:31,220
Because the aspect of our consciousness

805
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,960
with which we notice things is very limited.

806
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,600
It notices what it calls facts,

807
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:42,948
things and events and pinpoints

808
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,460
them. It pulls them out as significant.

809
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,384
You see, when you remember coming here and what you saw

810
00:55:51,472 --> 00:55:55,016
and who was here, you only remember very tiny

811
00:55:55,048 --> 00:55:56,460
bits of the whole scene.

812
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,832
You will not remember what very many people wore unless you

813
00:56:01,856 --> 00:56:05,608
happen to be interested in clothes. You won't really

814
00:56:05,664 --> 00:56:09,576
remember how they did their hair, what their styles were. Unless you are peculiarly

815
00:56:09,608 --> 00:56:13,010
interested in hairstyles. You probably won't notice their

816
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:17,522
shoes at all and goodness

817
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:21,030
knows what else that nobody has ever thought to notice.

818
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:26,434
But when, under certain circumstances, our consciousness

819
00:56:26,482 --> 00:56:28,870
becomes expanded, as in mystical vision,

820
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:33,350
you begin to become aware of things that you don't notice.

821
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:37,380
One of the most important things that. That we don't notice is space.

822
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,980
Most people regard space as nothing.

823
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,580
It's just a void in which we move around.

824
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,940
But actually, space is terribly important. It has properties.

825
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,140
We are all something happening in space.

826
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,300
In rather the same way that a whirlpool occurs in water.

827
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,212
Space has turns in.

828
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:08,640
Has ripples in it. It has places where it's denser than at other places.

829
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,920
And this is all becoming clear in physics.

830
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,252
But it's certainly not impinged upon the consciousness of the

831
00:57:16,276 --> 00:57:17,800
average intelligent person.

832
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:23,148
So the space in which we live and move and have our being

833
00:57:23,284 --> 00:57:27,160
is an intelligent continuum. It isn't just nothing at all.

834
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:31,410
There's one little lesson about this that I will.

835
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:35,798
That you must excuse me for repeating. If you've heard it before, but it's very

836
00:57:35,854 --> 00:57:39,350
important, and it's a lesson in the value of

837
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:43,078
space. And it's showing you that space

838
00:57:43,134 --> 00:57:46,470
and energy are the same thing. Let us

839
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:50,530
suppose that we have a universe in which there is only one ball,

840
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:54,900
and that's all there is. There isn't anything else.

841
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,900
Nobody can say of this ball whether it's moving or not.

842
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,260
Therefore, it doesn't appear to manifest any energy.

843
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,860
You can't say it's moving, and you can't actually say it's still.

844
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,792
There's no way of thinking about it. Now,

845
00:58:13,816 --> 00:58:16,220
introduce into our universe a second ball,

846
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,740
and we notice that they get further apart.

847
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,620
Now, one of them is moving, or both are moving,

848
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,408
but we can't decide which. We only know there is energy here,

849
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:33,120
there is motion. Why do we know there's energy? Because the space between

850
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,180
them alters, either increases or decreases.

851
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:40,640
Now let's have three balls, and you

852
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,860
find two of them stay close to each other.

853
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,660
The other one gets further away. Now, which one is moving?

854
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:51,272
The majority is going to decide. The two that stay together are

855
00:58:51,296 --> 00:58:54,776
going to say we are moving away from that one. Or else,

856
00:58:54,808 --> 00:58:57,992
if they want to argue it differently, they say we are standing still and that

857
00:58:58,016 --> 00:59:01,720
one is moving away from us. You see, all these

858
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,704
views are equally true. But if an argument starts up,

859
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:09,560
the majority is going to win. But the point is,

860
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:13,220
you see, space and energy are fundamentally related.

861
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:18,490
There is no manifestation of energy without space.

862
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:23,870
Also, we can drag in time. But I don't want to make it complicated.

863
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:27,774
I want to make this little image as simple as possible, so as to understand

864
00:59:27,942 --> 00:59:32,062
the importance of space, that is to say, of the surroundings,

865
00:59:32,126 --> 00:59:35,886
of things, of the background. And the background is

866
00:59:35,958 --> 00:59:39,412
ignored in ordinary consciousness. But in mystical consciousness, the background

867
00:59:39,446 --> 00:59:40,900
background becomes important.

868
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,368
You become aware vividly of the fact that

869
00:59:47,424 --> 00:59:54,220
you as a an individual imply

870
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:00,600
by your existence everything else that exists or

871
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,100
ever has existed or ever will exist.

872
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:08,100
You can't exist as the kind of person you are without all that.

873
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,300
Now that's the secret to the connection between you and the cosmos.

874
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:22,640
Just as a back doesn't exist without a front in

875
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:26,176
just that sort of way, all of it doesn't exist without

876
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:29,580
you, and you don't exist without all of it.

877
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,340
Even if you die, you see and disappear totally.

878
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,816
Nevertheless, the fact that you have existed

879
01:00:38,848 --> 01:00:42,448
is still a fact. And a universe in which there

880
01:00:42,504 --> 01:00:46,368
has been a person like Socrates is quite

881
01:00:46,384 --> 01:00:49,696
a different universe from a universe in which there hadn't

882
01:00:49,728 --> 01:00:53,696
been a person like Socrates. Socrates having

883
01:00:53,768 --> 01:00:59,802
existed is a symptom of the way things are so

884
01:00:59,826 --> 01:01:03,882
fundamentally we get a picture of the cosmos in which

885
01:01:04,066 --> 01:01:07,274
the self, the real I is the whole

886
01:01:07,322 --> 01:01:10,538
thing, just as we say of an individual human

887
01:01:10,594 --> 01:01:14,346
body. You are John Doe and that's all of you.

888
01:01:14,498 --> 01:01:17,898
Although if we look at you very carefully under an electron microscope,

889
01:01:17,994 --> 01:01:21,306
we will find that molecules in your blood are further apart

890
01:01:21,338 --> 01:01:24,910
than the earth and the sun. What makes you think you're a unity?

891
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:31,120
It's quite a thought. Well, it's space.

892
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:36,852
And so in the same way as such a relationship

893
01:01:36,916 --> 01:01:40,420
exists between our, our galaxy and other

894
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:42,600
galaxies and so on, it's obvious.

895
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:50,642
So then by

896
01:01:50,836 --> 01:01:54,170
various conventions and social institutions,

897
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:59,050
we develop the impression that this isn't so. We learn to ignore.

898
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:03,062
We learn not to notice certain things. And you

899
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:07,062
know, not noticing is very, very important in

900
01:02:07,086 --> 01:02:09,130
the Hindu theory of politics.

901
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:15,750
All the what our spiritual virtues have

902
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:20,040
political counterparts. For example,

903
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:25,480
in the spiritual domain, the word upaya,

904
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:29,796
up a y a means merciful

905
01:02:29,988 --> 01:02:32,480
techniques for awakening people,

906
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:37,300
clever devices used by a teacher in

907
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:41,970
the politic. In the political domain, the word upaya means Cunningham

908
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,566
deceit. Likewise in the spiritual domain,

909
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:48,290
upeksha means equanimity.

910
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:51,890
In the political domain, upeksha means overlooking.

911
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:57,278
When for example, the boss of a big concern finds

912
01:02:57,294 --> 01:03:01,570
that one of his employees is taking out a little bit of the petty cash.

913
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:06,650
Now he figures out is this man worth it?

914
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:10,686
Are his services really worth it? And shall I merely

915
01:03:10,718 --> 01:03:14,130
ignore the fact that he's doing this? That would be upeksha.

916
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:19,182
Now in our whole society we do an enormous amount

917
01:03:19,246 --> 01:03:22,670
of upeksha. The things we

918
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:25,950
overlook. There are obvious things

919
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:29,182
that we don't talk about. There is a taboo side to life that we

920
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:32,638
don't mention. It's we're supposed to overlook

921
01:03:32,654 --> 01:03:36,522
it. You know, when silk stockings were first in invented with

922
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:40,042
a fine mesh type, a present of several dozen of

923
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:43,546
them was sent by important American businessman

924
01:03:43,578 --> 01:03:44,830
to the Queen of Spain.

925
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:49,882
And they were returned by her chamberlain with

926
01:03:49,906 --> 01:03:53,338
a letter which said, you should recognize that her majesty

927
01:03:53,354 --> 01:03:55,950
the Queen of Spain has no legs.

928
01:03:58,290 --> 01:04:01,150
In other words, those legs don't officially exist.

929
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:08,290
So only what exists officially is

930
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:12,450
what is noticed and as we say, noted noteworthy.

931
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:15,550
Make a note of it in your mind in your date book.

932
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:19,986
Noting and noticing notation. You see,

933
01:04:20,058 --> 01:04:23,810
they're all based on the same idea, what we

934
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:27,704
attend to. But there are a lot of very

935
01:04:27,842 --> 01:04:30,160
attention worthy things that we ignore.

936
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:35,800
But part of the whole game, you see, of a cosmos is played

937
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:39,276
in this way. Imagine the cosmos as a great

938
01:04:39,348 --> 01:04:42,652
harp. You know, the angels are

939
01:04:42,676 --> 01:04:45,852
supposed to play harps in heaven. Now the

940
01:04:45,876 --> 01:04:50,748
actual harp, they Play is the total possibility

941
01:04:50,844 --> 01:04:53,942
of vibrations. Now you know about

942
01:04:53,966 --> 01:04:57,382
the spectrum of light, that is a series of vibrations,

943
01:04:57,526 --> 01:05:01,650
so is the spectrum of sound. Then beyond light,

944
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:05,350
there are other vibrations which are not picked up by our

945
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:09,078
senses, but instruments pick them up.

946
01:05:09,214 --> 01:05:12,662
And then there must also be many vibrations as yet not

947
01:05:12,686 --> 01:05:15,250
picked up by any instruments that we have.

948
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:21,870
Now, what is, you see, what we call nature is

949
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:23,970
a system of picked up vibrations.

950
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:28,530
Some vibrations aren't picked up and therefore nothing appears.

951
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:32,350
That's why it seems that the space around things, because the vibrations there

952
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:34,930
aren't picked up, they're not noticed.

953
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:39,406
And this is why there is a whole domain of Hindu and Buddhist philosophy

954
01:05:39,438 --> 01:05:43,278
called tantra. Tantra refers to the idea

955
01:05:43,294 --> 01:05:46,618
of weaving. And so when you have a warp

956
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:47,830
and a woof,

957
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:54,578
the weaver decides what threads are going to be picked up

958
01:05:54,634 --> 01:05:58,530
and appear on the front, which is what everybody's going to look at. And what

959
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:02,162
threads will be overlooked, repressed, put behind the

960
01:06:02,186 --> 01:06:05,794
scenes they'll be behind. And so it will appear

961
01:06:05,882 --> 01:06:08,690
that we have a birdie here and a birdie there and a birdie there,

962
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:12,260
and no connection between the birdies. Actually, if you look on the other side,

963
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:16,256
you will see that the red threads which made the birdies against the white background

964
01:06:16,368 --> 01:06:20,100
continues only that's not noticed.

965
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,400
So in this way, we are taught from childhood.

966
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:28,416
We are indoctrinated in a system of social institutions that

967
01:06:28,488 --> 01:06:32,176
are simply rules about what is to be noticed

968
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:36,432
and what is not to be noticed. That's why children are sometimes

969
01:06:36,496 --> 01:06:40,030
very odd questions about things that adults don't notice.

970
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:45,178
The famous story of the the little boy who's been taken

971
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:48,826
to a concert where a lady is singing and

972
01:06:48,978 --> 01:07:04,276
he says, mama, why does she scream when she yawns so?

973
01:07:04,348 --> 01:07:08,200
And in the same way, inventive poets

974
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:12,880
put together images that people never thought of before.

975
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:17,732
It's like Yeats's famous phrase, the be loud

976
01:07:17,796 --> 01:07:21,332
glade, you know, it is a beautiful idea for

977
01:07:21,356 --> 01:07:24,200
a nice glade to be beloud.

978
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:28,052
And everybody says, wow, think of that. We never thought of that before. We never

979
01:07:28,076 --> 01:07:30,320
thought of it in just that way. We didn't know notice that.

980
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:36,932
Then, you see, we don't notice the

981
01:07:36,956 --> 01:07:40,868
most obvious thing of all. That's of course, the last

982
01:07:40,924 --> 01:07:45,780
thing that we would notice. What is most obvious and

983
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:49,160
the question, the fundamental koan, as it would be called in Zen,

984
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,560
is what is it you haven't noticed?

985
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:59,614
