1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,696
Imagine for a moment that life itself is a dance and you are the dancer.

2
00:00:04,888 --> 00:00:08,568
Now consider this. If you were to move with the confidence that each step,

3
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,180
each sway would take you exactly where you need to be,

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,740
wouldn't you dance with more grace, more joy, more ease?

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,248
In the same way, when you act as if everything always works out for you,

6
00:00:20,384 --> 00:00:23,740
the entire rhythm of life shifts to support that belief.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,140
You see, reality is not fixed or rigid. It bends.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,200
It moves in response to the energy we bring to it.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,052
When we walk through life, assuming that things are bound to fall apart, that obstacles

10
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:38,560
are inevitable, we invite just that.

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,452
But if we move forward with the quiet assurance that the universe is

12
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:45,604
on our side, that things will unfold in our favor,

13
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:49,124
suddenly life begins to reflect that very certainty

14
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:53,160
back to us. It's not about blind faith,

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,690
nor is it about pretending challenges do not exist.

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,006
It's about meeting those challenges with a mindset that transforms

17
00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:05,038
them. By embracing the unknown, by stepping into

18
00:01:05,094 --> 00:01:08,542
uncertainty, with a heart full of trust, you discover a

19
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:11,310
strange and wonderful thing. Life flows more freely.

20
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,326
Problems become opportunities. Setbacks become detours

21
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:18,410
that lead to places you didn't even realize you needed to go.

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,096
To act as if everything works out for you is not to deny reality,

23
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,192
but rather to reshape it. We must understand that our thoughts,

24
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:31,060
our beliefs, have a profound influence on the reality we experience.

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,432
Think of your mind as the sun casting light over the landscape of

26
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:39,208
your life. If you cast a shadow of doubt, fear and

27
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:42,060
uncertainty, the world will appear dim, harsh.

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,502
But if you radiate trust, positivity and calm, everything takes on

29
00:01:46,526 --> 00:01:50,250
a different hue. One that invites growth, one that breeds possibilities.

30
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,630
And then there's the beauty of detachment. When you let

31
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,150
go of the need to control outcomes, when you stop clinging to how things should

32
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,078
be, you create space for how things could be.

33
00:02:01,214 --> 00:02:04,806
In that space, life breathes. It moves

34
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:07,930
with a kind of wisdom that often surpasses our understanding.

35
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,862
The outcome may not be what you expected, but you trust that

36
00:02:11,886 --> 00:02:15,782
it is what you need. Resilience naturally

37
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:19,718
follows this trust. Acting as if things always work

38
00:02:19,774 --> 00:02:22,966
out does not mean you won't face challenges. But it means you'll

39
00:02:22,998 --> 00:02:26,422
meet those challenges with an inner knowing that somehow they are part

40
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:30,246
of the process. Even the hardest moments contain

41
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:33,430
within them the seeds of transformation. With each

42
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,410
difficulty you learn, you adapt, you become stronger.

43
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,258
You begin to notice, too, how your energy attracts what surrounds

44
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:44,890
you. When you carry the belief that life supports you,

45
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,682
opportunities arise that match that belief. People are drawn to

46
00:02:48,706 --> 00:02:53,066
your confidence not because you hold the answers, but because you trust the unfolding

47
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:56,490
of your own journey. The world opens to those

48
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,990
who move through it with a sense of inner faith.

49
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,310
And most importantly, this way of living roots you firmly in the present.

50
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,004
It removes the burden of constantly fretting over an unknown

51
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:11,684
future. You are here now, acting with the certainty

52
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:15,652
that whatever comes, you will meet it with grace. You'll find

53
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:17,600
the path. You'll grow.

54
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,748
In the end, the choice is yours. Will you live with fear,

55
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:25,252
clinging to every outcome? Or will you choose the freedom that

56
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:28,868
comes with trusting life's flow? Acting as if

57
00:03:28,924 --> 00:03:32,288
everything always works out for you isn't about forcing life

58
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:35,392
into a box. It's about allowing it to bloom in ways you

59
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:39,152
never thought possible. Trust. Move and know

60
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:42,496
that in the grand dance of life, every step leads you exactly

61
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:46,272
where you need to be. The way we perceive the

62
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:50,160
world shapes the reality we experience. Our thoughts, beliefs and

63
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,680
attitudes serve as a lens through which we interpret every event,

64
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,300
interaction and moment in our lives.

65
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,842
If you expect obstacles, you will find them at every turn. But if you

66
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:05,310
expect things to flow smoothly, life tends to mirror that expectation.

67
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,946
Perception is a powerful force. It colors our interpretation

68
00:04:09,978 --> 00:04:13,722
of what's happening around us. Consider two people experiencing the

69
00:04:13,746 --> 00:04:17,866
same event. One sees a setback, while the other sees a stepping stone.

70
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:21,270
It's not the event itself that differs, but their perception of it.

71
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:25,571
This difference in how we view life can drastically alter the quality of

72
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:29,379
our experience. By shifting your mindset and acting as though

73
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:33,091
things are always working out for you, you change the way you interact with

74
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:37,059
the world. Opportunities begin to appear where there one

75
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:40,451
seem to be. Dead ends and challenges become avenues for

76
00:04:40,475 --> 00:04:43,699
growth. Life responds to the energy you bring

77
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:47,507
into it. When you view the world through a lens of possibility,

78
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:50,143
it reflects the possibility back to you.

79
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,896
It's not magic. It's the way the mind filters information and focuses

80
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:56,620
on what aligns with your internal beliefs.

81
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,552
If you believe that good things are meant for you, you will

82
00:05:00,576 --> 00:05:04,104
start to notice them. Whereas if you believe the opposite,

83
00:05:04,152 --> 00:05:07,768
your mind will filter the world in a way that confirms your doubts and

84
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:11,896
fears. The more you embrace the idea that everything works

85
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:14,776
out, the more you begin to live in harmony with that idea.

86
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:18,414
This shift in perception opens you up to new experiences and

87
00:05:18,472 --> 00:05:22,230
deeper insights and a broader perspective on life's events.

88
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,882
By reshaping how you view your circumstances, you step into a

89
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:30,034
reality that aligns with your more optimistic outlook.

90
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:33,842
You begin to experience life not as something happening to you, but as

91
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:38,402
something co created with your own awareness and energy. This realization

92
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:41,874
is liberating. It gives you the ability to shift

93
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:45,342
your world from the Inside out, knowing that your perception,

94
00:05:45,406 --> 00:05:48,370
more than external factors, defines your reality.

95
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,294
Uncertainty is a natural part of life, yet so often we resist it,

96
00:05:53,382 --> 00:05:57,038
craving stability and control over the unfolding of events.

97
00:05:57,214 --> 00:06:00,574
But the truth is, life is an unpredictable flow,

98
00:06:00,702 --> 00:06:03,966
and no matter how much we try to plan or anticipate,

99
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:08,190
the future remains unknown. In embracing uncertainty,

100
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,050
we shift our mindset from fear to openness. We stop seeing the

101
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,350
unknown as a threat and start viewing it as a space of possibility.

102
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,986
When you act as if everything works out for you, you no longer

103
00:06:20,018 --> 00:06:23,250
cling to rigid expectations about how things should unfold.

104
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,186
Instead, you allow life to surprise you. This doesn't mean abandoning

105
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:30,962
all plans or goals, but rather recognizing that the path to

106
00:06:30,986 --> 00:06:34,754
those goals may not always be clear or linear. Often,

107
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:39,086
the greatest gifts come in ways we never anticipated. The detours

108
00:06:39,118 --> 00:06:42,462
and unexpected turns are part of life's richness. And when we

109
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,902
open ourselves to uncertainty, we allow space for these

110
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:49,566
gifts to enter. There is a kind of freedom

111
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:52,990
in not knowing what comes next. It relieves the pressure of having

112
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,974
to control every aspect of our lives. When we embrace uncertainty,

113
00:06:57,022 --> 00:07:00,718
we learn to trust the process. We move with the current

114
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:04,846
of life rather than against it, flowing through challenges and opportunities alike

115
00:07:04,878 --> 00:07:08,714
with grace. This mindset helps us remain flexible,

116
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:12,310
adaptable, and more resilient in the face of change.

117
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,890
Life, in its wisdom, often leads us to exactly where we need

118
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,710
to be, even if we can't see the path clearly from where we stand.

119
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,730
By stepping into the unknown with the belief that everything will work out,

120
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,042
we are not ignoring the risks or challenges. We are simply trusting that

121
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:30,790
whatever comes, we will find our way through.

122
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,108
We stop wasting energy on trying to predict or control outcomes,

123
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:38,840
and instead focus on responding to life with presence and courage.

124
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,960
In the end, it's about accepting that we don't need to have all the answers.

125
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,820
The unknown becomes a playground for growth, creativity, and new experiences.

126
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,884
When you act as if life is unfolding in your favor, even uncertainty becomes

127
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:56,612
less daunting. It becomes a partner in your journey,

128
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,720
rather than an obstacle to be feared.

129
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,680
Thoughts and intentions are like seeds planted in the soil of our minds.

130
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,420
What we think and intend sets the stage for what unfolds in our

131
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,668
lives. When you act as if everything works out for you,

132
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:14,600
your thoughts align with that belief and your actions follow.

133
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,244
This isn't just positive thinking. It's a deeper understanding of how your internal

134
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:22,748
world shapes your external reality. Every action you take

135
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:26,780
stems from the thoughts and intentions you hold. When those thoughts are rooted in

136
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,330
confidence and trust, your entire approach to life shifts.

137
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,678
Your mind is Constantly interpreting the world and

138
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:38,294
the thoughts you dwell on create the filters through which you see everything.

139
00:08:38,462 --> 00:08:42,022
If your thoughts are clouded by fear, doubt, or negativity, you will

140
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:45,610
likely interpret life's events in a way that confirms those feelings.

141
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,134
However, when your thoughts are grounded in the belief that life supports you,

142
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:53,526
that things are always working out in your favor, you begin

143
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:56,410
to see possibilities where others might see obstacles.

144
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,182
It's not that the external world changes, but your perception of it

145
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,526
does. Intentions act like a compass,

146
00:09:03,638 --> 00:09:07,142
guiding your actions toward your desired outcomes. When your

147
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:10,822
intentions are clear and aligned with positivity, they direct your

148
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:14,694
energy in a focused way. Imagine starting your day with the intention

149
00:09:14,742 --> 00:09:18,170
that everything will work out no matter what challenges arise.

150
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,878
This doesn't mean difficulties disappear, but rather that you approach

151
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:24,330
them with a mindset of trust and adaptability.

152
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,878
Your intentions shape how you respond, and how you respond shapes

153
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:32,830
your experience. The power of thought and intention also

154
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,606
extends to how we influence the energy around us. Thoughts carry

155
00:09:36,638 --> 00:09:40,142
energy, and when you focus on the belief that life supports you,

156
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,582
that energy radiates outward. It influences not

157
00:09:43,606 --> 00:09:47,006
only your mood and behavior, but also how others interact

158
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:50,494
with you. People are drawn to those who exude

159
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:53,932
calm, confidence and positivity. The energy you

160
00:09:53,956 --> 00:09:57,612
project attracts experiences that resonate with it. It's as

161
00:09:57,636 --> 00:10:00,520
though life mirrors back the vibration you send out.

162
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,180
Moreover, the act of setting intentions shifts your focus from

163
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,412
passivity to active creation. Rather than waiting for

164
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:12,800
life to happen to you, you become a participant in shaping your own reality.

165
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,356
You begin to see that life is not something to be feared or controlled,

166
00:10:17,468 --> 00:10:20,560
but something to be engaged with mindfully and purposefully.

167
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,004
When your thoughts and intentions are aligned with trust,

168
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:27,636
your actions naturally lead you to outcomes that reflect that inner

169
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:31,300
state. Ultimately, the power of thought and

170
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,564
intention reminds us that our reality begins in the mind.

171
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:38,564
The more consciously we cultivate thoughts of abundance, trust, and peace,

172
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:42,164
the more our actions reflect those qualities, creating a reality

173
00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:44,520
that mirrors back our deepest intentions.

174
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,012
Detachment from outcomes is not about apathy or indifference.

175
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:52,392
It's about freeing yourself from the need to control every detail of how

176
00:10:52,476 --> 00:10:55,856
life unfolds. When you act as if everything

177
00:10:55,928 --> 00:10:59,712
works out for you, you release the pressure of constantly striving for a

178
00:10:59,736 --> 00:11:03,100
specific outcome and instead trust the flow of life.

179
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,312
This doesn't mean you lack ambition or don't set goals. It means you

180
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:11,200
stop clinging to the idea that your happiness or success depends on things

181
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,140
turning out exactly as you planned.

182
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,140
Attachment to outcomes creates tension.

183
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,722
When we are fixated on a particular result, we often close ourselves off

184
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:25,930
to other possibilities that may be even better suited for us, by becoming

185
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,626
too focused on a narrow idea of success, we miss the broader

186
00:11:29,658 --> 00:11:33,322
picture of what life is offering. Detachment allows us

187
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:37,082
to stay open, to recognize that there are countless ways for things to

188
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:40,190
work out, many of which we may not have envisioned.

189
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,650
The paradox of detachment is that by letting go of the need for

190
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,082
things to unfold in a specific way, we actually invite more

191
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:51,938
favorable outcomes. When you're overly attached to a certain result,

192
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:55,442
you become rigid in your approach. And that rigidity can

193
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,510
block the natural flow of opportunities.

194
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,130
By embracing detachment, you create space for unexpected

195
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,426
solutions, for life to surprise you with paths you hadn't

196
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,866
considered. This openness invites a more fluid,

197
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,590
adaptable way of being.

198
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,784
Letting go of attachment to outcomes also brings a sense of peace.

199
00:12:15,962 --> 00:12:19,436
So much of our stress comes from trying to control what is ultimately beyond

200
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:22,860
our control. When you detach from the outcome, you place your

201
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,636
trust in the process. You act with intention,

202
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:29,980
but you are not attached to the idea that only one specific

203
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,932
result will bring you happiness or fulfillment. You recognize that

204
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:37,196
the journey itself holds value and that whatever happens

205
00:12:37,228 --> 00:12:39,240
along the way is part of your growth.

206
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,040
This mindset encourages resilience.

207
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,044
When things don't go as planned, you don't see it as failure,

208
00:12:47,172 --> 00:12:50,308
but as part of a larger process that's unfolding.

209
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:54,356
You adapt, adjust, and move forward without feeling crushed

210
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:57,492
by disappointment. Detachment gives you

211
00:12:57,516 --> 00:13:01,220
the flexibility to shift and flow with life's changes, knowing that

212
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,320
no single outcome defines your worth or your success.

213
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,996
In letting go of the need for control, you embrace trust.

214
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,756
You trust that whatever happens, it is working out in your favor,

215
00:13:12,868 --> 00:13:16,308
even if it doesn't appear so in the moment. This faith allows

216
00:13:16,324 --> 00:13:19,796
you to act without the burden of constant anxiety over whether you'll achieve

217
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:23,636
a specific result. Instead, you can engage fully

218
00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:27,440
in the present moment, confident that life is unfolding as it should.

219
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,564
Resilience is born from faith, a deep rooted trust

220
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:35,956
that no matter what happens, you have the strength and capacity to endure

221
00:13:35,988 --> 00:13:39,418
and grow. When you act as if everything works

222
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:42,810
out for you, you cultivate this inner resilience, knowing that

223
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,590
challenges are not the end of the story, but simply part of a larger journey.

224
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,554
Faith doesn't mean blind optimism or ignoring difficulties.

225
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:53,850
It means holding onto the belief that even when things seem uncertain or

226
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,642
tough, there is a greater unfolding at play and you will

227
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:01,402
find your way through. Faith acts as a steady foundation

228
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:05,022
when the winds of life grow turbulent. It's an inner assurance that

229
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:08,990
while you can't always predict what will happen, you can trust in your ability to

230
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,654
navigate whatever comes your way. When you approach

231
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:16,382
life with the mindset that things will work out, you become more

232
00:14:16,406 --> 00:14:20,190
flexible in the face of adversity. Obstacles don't feel

233
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,134
like roadblocks. They become opportunities to adjust,

234
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:27,342
adapt, and grow stronger. Resilience emerges

235
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:31,224
because you don't view setbacks as permanent failures, but as temporary

236
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:34,940
detours that may lead to unexpected growth or new directions.

237
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,376
This kind of faith fosters a calmness that carries you through difficult times.

238
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:43,592
It's not about denying hardship, but rather about acknowledging that

239
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:47,592
even in hardship, there's a way forward. When you believe that

240
00:14:47,616 --> 00:14:52,380
life supports you, you're less likely to be overwhelmed by temporary setbacks.

241
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,870
You know that you have the strength to overcome them,

242
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,362
and that with time, things will realign in ways that may be

243
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:02,470
even more beneficial than you initially imagined.

244
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:08,070
Moreover, faith empowers resilience by helping you maintain perspective.

245
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,602
Life is full of ups and downs, but when you hold onto the belief that

246
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:15,110
things will ultimately work out, you don't get stuck in the lows.

247
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,186
You understand that whatever challenge you're facing is part of a larger

248
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,466
picture, and you trust that the difficulties you encounter

249
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:25,800
are only temporary. This belief allows you to keep

250
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,400
moving forward with hope, even in the face of uncertainty or

251
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,288
difficulty. Resilience through faith also

252
00:15:33,344 --> 00:15:36,648
means that you trust in your own ability to grow from hardship.

253
00:15:36,824 --> 00:15:40,840
It's not just about getting through difficult times, but about emerging from them with

254
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,712
greater strength and wisdom. Every challenge becomes a

255
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:48,584
chance to deepen your understanding of yourself, to refine your approach to life,

256
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:52,662
and to cultivate more inner strength. In this way, faith in

257
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:56,742
yourself and in the process of life transforms obstacles into stepping stones for

258
00:15:56,766 --> 00:16:00,054
greater resilience. Ultimately,

259
00:16:00,102 --> 00:16:03,318
when you act as if everything works out, you reinforce a cycle

260
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:06,982
of resilience. Each time you face a challenge and come through it,

261
00:16:07,006 --> 00:16:09,690
your faith in yourself and in life grows stronger.

262
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,798
This faith becomes the bedrock that allows you to keep going,

263
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:17,462
knowing that no matter what happens, you have the inner resources to weather

264
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,730
any storm and come out on the other side.

265
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,916
Positive energy has a natural magnetism drawing toward

266
00:16:24,948 --> 00:16:28,260
you. The experiences, people, and opportunities that align with

267
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,876
the frequency you project. When you act as if everything works

268
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:36,068
out for you, you emit an energy that is calm, confident, and open

269
00:16:36,124 --> 00:16:39,636
to possibilities. This energy doesn't just affect

270
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:43,200
your inner state, it ripples outward, influencing your environment

271
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,920
and how others perceive and respond to you.

272
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,686
The mindset of believing that life supports you not only changes

273
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:52,902
how you navigate the world, but also attracts situations that

274
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:56,998
reflect that belief. This magnetism is rooted

275
00:16:57,014 --> 00:17:00,166
in the principle that like attracts like. When you carry

276
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:03,702
a sense of optimism and trust Your actions, words, and even your presence

277
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:07,622
radiate that energy. People are naturally drawn to

278
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:11,238
individuals who exude positivity, not just because it feels

279
00:17:11,254 --> 00:17:14,250
good to be around them, but because they represent possibility.

280
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,564
Positive energy is infectious. It lifts the mood of

281
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:22,756
those around you, creates a sense of ease, and encourages others to open up,

282
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:26,080
collaborate, and engage with you. On a deeper level,

283
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,720
opportunities also tend to align with the energy you project.

284
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,660
When you move through life with the expectation that things will work

285
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,680
out, you're more likely to spot opportunities that others may overlook.

286
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,172
It's not that the opportunities weren't there before, but your mindset, one of

287
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:46,312
openness and receptivity, allows you to recognize them more easily.

288
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,992
Easily. This heightened awareness,

289
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:53,024
combined with your positive energy, makes you a magnet for success,

290
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:56,256
drawing circumstances that align with your inner confidence

291
00:17:56,288 --> 00:17:59,680
and trust in life. Moreover,

292
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,488
positive energy helps to foster resilience in the face of challenges.

293
00:18:03,664 --> 00:18:06,400
When difficulties arise, as they inevitably do,

294
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,580
your positive outlook allows you to navigate them with a sense of calm and purpose.

295
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,296
Instead of being weighed down by negativity or fear, you approach

296
00:18:15,368 --> 00:18:19,216
problems with the belief that they can be overcome, and this belief shapes

297
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:23,360
your response. It makes you more resourceful, creative and determined,

298
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,460
which in turn attracts solutions.

299
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,896
Positive energy also influences the relationships you cultivate.

300
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:34,528
People are drawn to individuals who seem grounded, optimistic and

301
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:38,064
kind. When you act as if everything is working out for you,

302
00:18:38,152 --> 00:18:41,904
you naturally attract others who are on the same wavelength, people who uplift,

303
00:18:41,952 --> 00:18:45,092
support, and inspire you. This creates a

304
00:18:45,116 --> 00:18:48,116
powerful feedback loop. The more positive energy you project,

305
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:51,380
the more you attract positive influences into your life,

306
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,960
which further reinforces your mindset.

307
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,756
At the same time, it's important to remember that positive energy doesn't

308
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:02,516
mean ignoring the negative or pretending that challenges don't exist.

309
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:06,404
It's about choosing to focus on the possibility of good outcomes,

310
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:10,222
even in the face of difficulty. By maintaining an

311
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:14,222
attitude of openness and trust, you remain aligned with a flow of energy that

312
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:17,530
attracts favorable circumstances and nurtures growth.

313
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,550
This doesn't guarantee that everything will always be easy,

314
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,262
but it ensures that your outlook will continuously draw the best out

315
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:27,050
of whatever situation you face.

316
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,886
Ultimately, the magnetism of positive energy is a reflection

317
00:19:31,918 --> 00:19:35,150
of the inner state you cultivate. When you trust that

318
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,656
life is working in your favor, your energy naturally reflects

319
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:42,032
the trust. You move through the world with a

320
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:45,904
sense of lightness, and this lightness becomes a powerful force,

321
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:49,620
drawing to you the very things that support and uplift your journey.

322
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,560
Living in the present moment means fully immersing yourself in the here and

323
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,632
now without being pulled by the regrets of the past or

324
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,880
the anxieties of the future. It's a state

325
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,460
of mindfulness where your attention is focused on the current experience,

326
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,488
free from the need to control what will happen next or relive what has already

327
00:20:08,544 --> 00:20:11,912
happened. When you act as if everything always works out for

328
00:20:11,936 --> 00:20:15,016
you, living in the present becomes a natural byproduct

329
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,264
of that mindset. Instead of constantly

330
00:20:18,312 --> 00:20:22,376
worrying about how things will turn out, you trust that whatever unfolds

331
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:25,784
will be for your growth and benefit. By living in

332
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:29,032
the present, you free yourself from the mental chatter that often clouds your

333
00:20:29,056 --> 00:20:33,010
perception. So much of our stress comes from projecting fears about

334
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,590
the future or ruminating on past mistakes.

335
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,442
But when you are grounded in the moment, you realize that all you truly have

336
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:43,670
is now. The past cannot be changed, and the future is uncertain.

337
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,842
What you can control, however, is your awareness of the present moment. And in

338
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:49,710
that awareness lies great power.

339
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,258
Being fully present allows you to engage with life more deeply.

340
00:20:54,434 --> 00:20:58,470
You notice the richness of your current experience, whether it's a conversation or

341
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,286
a quiet moment, or even a challenge. You become more attuned

342
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:06,238
to your surroundings, your emotions, and the people around you. When you

343
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:09,758
act with the belief that things will work out. You stop wasting mental energy on

344
00:21:09,814 --> 00:21:13,790
scenarios that may never happen. You invest your energy in what you're doing right

345
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:17,886
now, trusting that by staying present, you are best preparing yourself for whatever

346
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:21,086
the future holds. Living in the present

347
00:21:21,158 --> 00:21:23,890
also means accepting uncertainty without anxiety.

348
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,576
When you trust that everything is unfolding as it should, you no longer

349
00:21:27,608 --> 00:21:30,180
feel the need to constantly anticipate what's next.

350
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,800
You allow life to take its course, engaging with each

351
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,660
moment as it comes, knowing that future moments will take care of themselves.

352
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,656
This doesn't mean you lack ambition or direction. It simply means you are no longer

353
00:21:41,688 --> 00:21:45,592
weighed down by the constant pull of what ifs. You are free to

354
00:21:45,616 --> 00:21:48,900
experience life as it is, rather than as you think it should be.

355
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,890
Furthermore, being present enhances your ability to respond to life's challenges with

356
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,522
clarity and calmness. When you're not preoccupied with outcomes or

357
00:21:57,546 --> 00:22:00,802
trapped in future worries, you are better able to see situations for what

358
00:22:00,826 --> 00:22:04,310
they are. And you can respond with intention rather than reaction.

359
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,578
This presence of mind gives you the space to act in alignment with your values

360
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,810
and desires, making choices that are rooted in the reality of

361
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,470
now rather than in fear of the unknown.

362
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,260
In relationships, living in the present allows you to connect with others more

363
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,052
genuinely. You're not distracted by thoughts of what you need to do

364
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:25,960
later or by judgments about what has happened before.

365
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,156
Instead, you are fully available to the person in front of you, listening Engaging

366
00:22:30,188 --> 00:22:33,564
and being open to the richness of that interaction. This presence

367
00:22:33,612 --> 00:22:37,388
fosters deeper, more authentic connections as you are truly attuned

368
00:22:37,404 --> 00:22:39,440
to the moment you're sharing with someone else.

369
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:44,102
Ultimately, living in the present moment aligns you with the flow of life.

370
00:22:44,206 --> 00:22:47,846
It removes the need for constant control and opens the door to greater peace,

371
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:51,462
clarity and fulfillment. When you trust that everything is

372
00:22:51,486 --> 00:22:55,254
working out for you, you release the mental burdens of the past and future,

373
00:22:55,422 --> 00:22:58,966
allowing yourself to fully embrace and experience the present where life truly

374
00:22:58,998 --> 00:23:02,566
happens. Empowerment comes from recognizing

375
00:23:02,598 --> 00:23:06,530
that in every moment, you have the ability to choose how you respond to life.

376
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,294
No matter what circumstances you face, your power lies in your response,

377
00:23:11,342 --> 00:23:14,530
whether that's in your thoughts, your attitude, or your actions.

378
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,974
When you act as if everything works out for you, you tap into this empowerment

379
00:23:19,102 --> 00:23:21,822
because you're no longer reacting from fear or doubt.

380
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:25,070
Instead, you make conscious choices that reflect trust, optimism,

381
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,570
and a belief in your ability to navigate whatever comes your way.

382
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:33,370
Choice is a powerful tool because it gives you ownership of your experience.

383
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,820
While you can't always control the external events of life, you have full control over

384
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,068
how you choose to perceive and engage with them. By making

385
00:23:41,124 --> 00:23:44,796
the decision to focus on possibilities rather than obstacles, on growth

386
00:23:44,868 --> 00:23:48,120
rather than setbacks, you shift the trajectory of your life.

387
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,316
Every choice you make, no matter how small, shapes the path

388
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:55,404
ahead. When you choose to act with the belief

389
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:59,378
that things will work out, you begin to see opportunities even in challenges.

390
00:23:59,524 --> 00:24:02,850
And this mindset fundamentally changes how you move through the world.

391
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,118
Empowerment through choice also means embracing responsibility for your life.

392
00:24:08,254 --> 00:24:11,558
It's easy to fall into the trap of believing that life happens to you,

393
00:24:11,694 --> 00:24:14,822
that you are a victim of circumstance. But when

394
00:24:14,846 --> 00:24:18,614
you understand that your choices, both in thought and action, create your reality,

395
00:24:18,742 --> 00:24:22,502
you reclaim your power. You are not at the mercy of external forces.

396
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:24,450
You are a co creator of your experience.

397
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,056
Each time you choose faith over fear, possibility of a limitation,

398
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:32,820
you are steering your life toward a more empowered, fulfilling direction.

399
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,992
This kind of empowerment extends beyond the immediate moment.

400
00:24:37,136 --> 00:24:40,752
The more you practice conscious choice, the more you build a sense of self trust.

401
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:44,512
You begin to recognize that no matter what life throws at you, you have the

402
00:24:44,536 --> 00:24:48,416
inner strength and wisdom to choose your response. This builds

403
00:24:48,448 --> 00:24:52,144
resilience and confidence because you are no longer dependent on external

404
00:24:52,192 --> 00:24:55,484
conditions for your sense of well being. Instead, you draw strength

405
00:24:55,532 --> 00:24:59,052
from the knowledge that you always have the ability to choose your next step and

406
00:24:59,076 --> 00:25:01,200
that choice is where your power resides.

407
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,900
Furthermore, choice allows you to align your actions with your values and

408
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,860
desires. When you act as if everything works out for you,

409
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,492
you're not just reacting to life, you're proactively creating the kind of life you want

410
00:25:12,516 --> 00:25:16,316
to live. Each decision you make becomes a reflection of your belief

411
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:20,156
in yourself and your vision for the future. This alignment

412
00:25:20,188 --> 00:25:24,188
between your beliefs and and your actions creates a sense of harmony and purpose,

413
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:28,652
empowering you to live more authentically and intentionally in

414
00:25:28,676 --> 00:25:32,444
relationships. The power of choice is equally transformative. You can't

415
00:25:32,492 --> 00:25:36,140
control how others behave, but you can choose how you engage, how you

416
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,364
communicate, and how you set boundaries. By choosing kindness,

417
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:43,948
understanding and respect, you cultivate healthier, more fulfilling connections

418
00:25:43,964 --> 00:25:47,932
with those around you. Empowerment through choice allows you to navigate even difficult

419
00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:51,242
relationships with grace, because you are anchored in your own ability

420
00:25:51,306 --> 00:25:53,110
to decide what's right for you.

421
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,434
Ultimately, empowerment through choice is about realizing that you are

422
00:25:57,442 --> 00:26:00,922
the architect of your own experience. Life will present you

423
00:26:00,946 --> 00:26:03,990
with countless circumstances, some of which are beyond your control.

424
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:08,138
But within every situation, you have the power to choose how you think,

425
00:26:08,194 --> 00:26:11,482
how you feel, and how you act. When you act

426
00:26:11,506 --> 00:26:14,842
as if everything is working out for you, you are making a conscious choice to

427
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:18,106
trust in life, to believe in your own resilience, and to engage

428
00:26:18,138 --> 00:26:21,962
with the world from a place of strength and possibility. This is

429
00:26:21,986 --> 00:26:25,322
the true essence of empowerment. In the

430
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:29,098
end, acting as if everything always works out for you is not just a mindset,

431
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:32,490
but a way of living that transforms your entire experience of life.

432
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,722
It begins with perception. Understanding that the way you see

433
00:26:35,746 --> 00:26:39,466
the world shapes your reality. By embracing uncertainty

434
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:42,842
and detaching from rigid outcomes, you free yourself to flow with

435
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:46,584
life's unpredictability. You harness the power of thought and intention,

436
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:49,660
recognizing that your inner world influences the outer.

437
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,560
Resilience is built through faith, faith in yourself, and in the process,

438
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,100
knowing that even challenges serve your growth.

439
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,568
Through this journey, you discover the magnetism of positive energy which

440
00:27:00,624 --> 00:27:03,780
attracts opportunities and people aligned with your highest good.

441
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,992
Living in the present moment allows you to experience life fully without the

442
00:27:08,016 --> 00:27:12,026
weight of the past or the anxiety of the future. And ultimately,

443
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:15,562
you find empowerment through choice, realizing that in each moment, you have

444
00:27:15,586 --> 00:27:18,550
the power to shape your reality through the decisions you make.

445
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,210
This way of being is not about avoiding difficulties or pretending life is always

446
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,602
easy. It's about choosing to trust that no matter

447
00:27:26,626 --> 00:27:30,042
what happens, you are capable of navigating life's complexities with grace,

448
00:27:30,186 --> 00:27:33,738
openness and strength. When you act as if everything works

449
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:37,064
out for you, you align yourself with the natural flow of life,

450
00:27:37,242 --> 00:27:41,276
creating a path where challenges become opportunities, uncertainty becomes

451
00:27:41,308 --> 00:27:45,996
possibility, and life itself becomes a journey of continual growth and unfolding.

452
00:27:46,188 --> 00:27:50,124
You are a fluke. You are A separate

453
00:27:50,172 --> 00:27:50,760
event.

454
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:57,212
And you run from the maternity ward to the crematorium and that's it,

455
00:27:57,236 --> 00:27:59,720
baby, that's it.

456
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,922
Now, why does anybody think that way? There's no

457
00:28:04,946 --> 00:28:07,230
reason to, because it isn't even scientific.

458
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,658
It's just a myth. And it's invented

459
00:28:11,674 --> 00:28:15,722
by people who wanted to feel a

460
00:28:15,746 --> 00:28:18,070
certain way, they want to play a certain game.

461
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:25,562
But we have this hostility to the external world because of the

462
00:28:25,586 --> 00:28:29,402
superstition, the myth, the absolutely unfounded

463
00:28:29,546 --> 00:28:32,954
theory that you yourself exist

464
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:36,970
only inside your skin. We feel

465
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:40,522
we have been hypnotized, literally hypnotized by

466
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:44,074
social convention into feeling and sensing

467
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:48,330
that we exist only inside our skins. There is in

468
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,818
our whole way of thinking the idea that we are a

469
00:28:51,874 --> 00:28:55,610
soul, a spiritual essence of some

470
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,800
kind imprisoned inside a body,

471
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,084
and that we look out upon a world that is foreign

472
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:04,960
to us.

473
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,484
Should you or not commit suicide? This is a good question.

474
00:29:10,652 --> 00:29:11,840
Why go on?

475
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,160
And you only go on if the game is worth the candle.

476
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,764
And so really, a satisfactory theory

477
00:29:21,812 --> 00:29:25,380
of the universe has to be one that's worth betting on.

478
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,660
That's a very. Seems to me absolutely elementary common sense.

479
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,620
If you make a theory of the universe which isn't worth betting on,

480
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,300
why bother? Just commit suicide.

481
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,760
But if you want to go on playing the game, you've got to have an

482
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,820
optimal theory for playing the game.

483
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,504
Otherwise there's no point in.

484
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:16,210
Is absolutely absurd. To say that we came into this world.

485
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,760
We didn't. We came out of it.

486
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,080
You see, when you make something,

487
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,068
you put it together,

488
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:35,212
you arrange parts, or you work from the outside to

489
00:30:35,236 --> 00:30:38,652
the inn as a. As a sculptor works on a stone or as the

490
00:30:38,676 --> 00:30:42,204
potter works on clay. But when you watch something growing,

491
00:30:42,252 --> 00:30:45,632
it works in exactly the opposite direction. It works from

492
00:30:45,656 --> 00:30:50,416
the inside to the outside. It expands,

493
00:30:50,608 --> 00:30:53,780
it burgeons, it blossoms.

494
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,912
You as a human being, you grow out of

495
00:31:02,936 --> 00:31:06,656
this physical universe in just exactly the same way that an apple

496
00:31:06,688 --> 00:31:10,160
grows off an apple tree. So let's say

497
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,620
the tree which grows apples is a tree which apples.

498
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,310
And a world in which human beings arrive is a world that peoples.

499
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:24,350
And so the existence of people is symptomatic of

500
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,750
the kind of universe we live in.

501
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,470
But you see, we. We curiously twist it.

502
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,810
We say, well, first of all, in the beginning there was nothing but gas and

503
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:39,408
rock. And then intelligence happen

504
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,700
to arise in it. You are a fl.

505
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,832
But we're thinking in a way, you see, that disconnects the

506
00:31:46,856 --> 00:31:49,140
intelligence from the rocks.

507
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,500
Where there are rocks, watch out,

508
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,272
watch out, because the rocks are going eventually to come

509
00:31:58,296 --> 00:32:01,904
alive. It's Only a

510
00:32:01,912 --> 00:32:06,000
matter of time. Just in the same way as the seed, the acorn is

511
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,532
eventually going to turn into the oak because it has the potentiality of

512
00:32:09,556 --> 00:32:13,440
that within it. Rocks are not dead.

513
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,332
From a strictly physical, scientific standpoint,

514
00:32:46,476 --> 00:32:49,772
this organism is a continuous

515
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:52,280
energy with everything else that's going on.

516
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,360
And if I am my foot, I am the sun.

517
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,570
Sa.

518
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,740
There are no such things as things,

519
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,580
that is to say, separate things or separate events.

520
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,780
That is only a way of talking.

521
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,730
If you can understand this, you're going to have no further problems.

522
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,102
You. You can't have an experience of nothing.

523
00:34:04,246 --> 00:34:08,150
Nature appalls a vacuum. So after you're dead, the only

524
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,022
thing that can happen is the same experience or the same sort of experience as

525
00:34:12,046 --> 00:34:13,050
when you were born.

526
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:19,350
In other words, we all know very well that after people die,

527
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,468
other people are born, and they're all

528
00:34:22,524 --> 00:34:26,004
you, only you could only experience it one at a

529
00:34:26,012 --> 00:34:30,100
time. Everybody is I. You all

530
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,572
know you're you. And wheresoever

531
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:36,948
beings exist throughout all galaxies, it doesn't make any difference.

532
00:34:37,044 --> 00:34:40,372
You are all of them. And when they come into

533
00:34:40,396 --> 00:34:43,668
being, that's you coming into being. Really.

534
00:34:43,724 --> 00:34:47,764
The fundamental, ultimate mystery, the only thing you need to know to understand

535
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,969
the deepest metaphysical secrets is

536
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:54,201
this, that for every outside there is

537
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:58,069
an inside, and for every inside there is an outside.

538
00:34:59,729 --> 00:35:02,869
And although they are different, they go together.

539
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,496
Buddhist philosophy speaks of the four

540
00:36:52,568 --> 00:36:53,780
invisibles.

541
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,180
Water to the fish,

542
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,470
air to the bird,

543
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,230
mind to mankind,

544
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,350
and enlightenment to the ignorant.

545
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,810
Because, you see, you never know

546
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:15,950
your own element.

547
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:24,442
Now, it's impossible, therefore, to give a

548
00:37:24,466 --> 00:37:28,262
definition of consciousness because we

549
00:37:28,286 --> 00:37:32,210
don't know anything outside it, just as the fish doesn't know anything outside water

550
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,890
and the bird doesn't know anything outside air.

551
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,610
We don't know unconsciousness.

552
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:45,850
We only know when we have been unconscious.

553
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:52,712
And so we are in a very difficult

554
00:37:52,776 --> 00:37:56,232
fix to attempt to define the subject of

555
00:37:56,256 --> 00:37:59,832
this seminar. We all know

556
00:37:59,856 --> 00:38:02,260
what it is, and yet none of us know what it is.

557
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,980
We know we're conscious.

558
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,864
It's the same sort of problem as to try to say what color your eyes

559
00:38:11,912 --> 00:38:16,072
are. I don't mean whether they're blue or brown, but the color of the

560
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:18,790
iris, the lens of the eye,

561
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:24,550
because we say it has no color, it's transparent, it's like pure glass.

562
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:31,250
And yet that might be a color to

563
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,670
somebody who had a different kind of eye.

564
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:41,394
An Englishman and an Hindu were once sitting in the backyard of

565
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,670
the Hindu's home.

566
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:48,022
And the Hindu was talking about

567
00:38:48,046 --> 00:38:51,558
the necessity of a background for the perception

568
00:38:51,574 --> 00:38:55,330
of any figure. So he said

569
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,262
against what background do you see those flowers? And he

570
00:39:00,286 --> 00:39:02,250
said, against the background of the hedge.

571
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:07,926
And against what background you see the hedge? He said, the background

572
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:12,224
of the hills. And against what background

573
00:39:12,272 --> 00:39:15,780
do you see the hills? He said, the background of the sky,

574
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,500
he said. And against what background do you see the sky?

575
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,020
The Englishman fell silent.

576
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,820
The Hindu said, it's the background of consciousness.

577
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,862
There, you see, we reach a limit and

578
00:39:37,886 --> 00:39:42,694
you can talk until all is blue about whether

579
00:39:42,782 --> 00:39:45,250
consciousness and reality are the same thing,

580
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:51,690
whether there really is ever any such thing as pure unconsciousness,

581
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,982
whether consciousness is eternal, whether, as the

582
00:39:57,086 --> 00:40:01,030
subjective idealists would say in philosophy, there is primarily

583
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:04,436
mind and all so called physical

584
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:08,680
and material existence is something in mind or something in consciousness.

585
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:14,200
You can debate that subject forever and ever and ever and come out nowhere.

586
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,068
There is no answer to the question when asked

587
00:40:20,124 --> 00:40:23,684
in that way. But it is helpful

588
00:40:23,732 --> 00:40:27,290
as a start to make things at once more simple

589
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:31,770
and perhaps a little more difficult by

590
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:39,742
overcoming at the beginning the

591
00:40:39,766 --> 00:40:43,134
traditional opposition between the spiritual and the material,

592
00:40:43,262 --> 00:40:45,010
or the mental and the material,

593
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,086
by the trick of talking about all

594
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:57,250
things, whether spiritual or physical,

595
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,290
in terms of pattern.

596
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:05,530
Because that's all anybody can really talk about.

597
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:12,046
You see, it's fundamental to our common sense, which was

598
00:41:12,118 --> 00:41:15,090
highly influenced by Aristotle in the book of Genesis,

599
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:20,552
that all forms are composed of some substance in

600
00:41:20,576 --> 00:41:24,460
roughly the same way as sculptures are made of stone

601
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,072
or pots made of clay. But a serious

602
00:41:30,136 --> 00:41:33,860
physicist no longer thinks in such terms about the material world.

603
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,420
He doesn't think it's made of anything.

604
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,856
Because what the physical process

605
00:41:42,928 --> 00:41:46,690
of nature is, is patterns. You could say

606
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:49,790
patterns of energy, but that's using the old

607
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:54,258
ceramic language. Patterns aren't made

608
00:41:54,314 --> 00:41:58,030
of energy. The patterning is the same thing as the energy.

609
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:01,842
So if you use the verb patterning as what the

610
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:05,378
universe is, then you get something

611
00:42:05,514 --> 00:42:09,310
that you can talk about. You can describe patterns, you can measure them.

612
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,972
You could say what a pattern is doing. Although a pattern isn't a

613
00:42:14,996 --> 00:42:18,524
thing, a pattern is a verb. It is a process, it's an

614
00:42:18,532 --> 00:42:21,740
activity. So we can say patterning is

615
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,372
what is going on. And consciousness is a

616
00:42:25,396 --> 00:42:28,780
kind of patterning, as we shall see. Just so

617
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,596
are flowers and human beings and stars,

618
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,880
trees, water, air,

619
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,410
everything, even space itself is a form of patterning.

620
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:44,406
And this means, in other words,

621
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:47,734
that the universe is what physicists

622
00:42:47,782 --> 00:42:49,410
would call an energy field.

623
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:57,990
And likewise, consciousness is

624
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:01,302
a field in the sense,

625
00:43:01,366 --> 00:43:05,320
say, that space is obviously a field, that is to say, an area

626
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,052
in which things happen. That's the primary meaning of field.

627
00:43:09,236 --> 00:43:13,404
A field is a playing field. A field in which something happens

628
00:43:13,452 --> 00:43:17,132
like an arena. Only when you use the

629
00:43:17,156 --> 00:43:20,876
word field in more, in the sense of physics, you mean

630
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:24,120
a field of forces like a magnetic field,

631
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,764
like a gravitational field. And the curious

632
00:43:28,812 --> 00:43:32,536
thing about fields is that they exercise their energy

633
00:43:32,688 --> 00:43:35,660
in a non mechanical way. For example,

634
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,560
if gravity were non field,

635
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,160
that is to say, if it were the ordinary sort of exercise of energy,

636
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,888
like the propagation of heat, or like someone

637
00:43:46,944 --> 00:43:50,472
pulling. Then when you put something on the ground, you put

638
00:43:50,496 --> 00:43:53,672
a good heavy lead plate on the ground that would

639
00:43:53,696 --> 00:43:57,256
be absorbing so much gravitational energy. And therefore anything

640
00:43:57,288 --> 00:44:00,896
you put on top of the plate would be less acted

641
00:44:00,928 --> 00:44:04,800
upon by gravity than the lead plate itself. And then

642
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,240
anything on top of that would be still less. And you would reduce the

643
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,696
energy of gravity by piling things up. But you don't. It doesn't make the slightest

644
00:44:11,728 --> 00:44:14,220
difference to the gravitational field.

645
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,704
So in the same way, if you take an electrical coil, say surrounding a plastic

646
00:44:20,752 --> 00:44:23,952
tube, you can put a current through that and

647
00:44:23,976 --> 00:44:27,392
you create a field within the tube. You can put

648
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:30,736
your hand inside the tube and nothing will happen to it. But the minute

649
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:34,384
you put something that is like steel inside the tube,

650
00:44:34,512 --> 00:44:38,720
it will get hot. But no heat will be generated until

651
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,032
the steel is inside the tube. Because the

652
00:44:42,056 --> 00:44:45,940
coil plus the steel equals heat.

653
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,624
But the coil has to polarize with the steel

654
00:44:50,672 --> 00:44:54,352
inside before anything happens at all. So that

655
00:44:54,376 --> 00:44:56,620
shows us that what is operating as a field.

656
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,920
Now think

657
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,980
then of the world as a field

658
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,448
characterized by patterning, which. For which another

659
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:13,500
name is energy.

660
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,560
And we are

661
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,180
going to have to treat consciousness

662
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,660
in rather the same way.

663
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:57,810
All people who are in a rush are

664
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:00,110
not related to the material present.

665
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:04,002
First thing, let's take. You're in a rush to get coffee. When you go to

666
00:46:04,026 --> 00:46:07,714
get up in the morning, what do you do? You take instant

667
00:46:07,762 --> 00:46:11,720
coffee. And that's a punishment for being in a hurry.

668
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,040
It doesn't taste of coffee. Not really.

669
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:22,692
So because you, you, you forced it. It's like forcing the growth of

670
00:46:22,716 --> 00:46:26,004
tomatoes. They don't taste of tomatoes anymore. Forced apples,

671
00:46:26,052 --> 00:46:28,760
they're called delicious. They're nothing but wet pith.

672
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,386
So this, this,

673
00:46:36,528 --> 00:46:40,090
this is showing that we aren't here,

674
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,010
we're insane, we're not all there, as they say.

675
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,610
But trying to get to something.

676
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:51,710
The result, the thing we thought we wanted, the thing that we thought

677
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,582
would be what would make us happy. You got to get something now.

678
00:46:55,606 --> 00:46:59,182
It's true, in order to not be hungry, you have to

679
00:46:59,206 --> 00:46:59,810
eat.

680
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,980
And therefore when you eat, there's a certain satisfaction,

681
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,728
feel. All right. But then when you

682
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:13,880
begin to consider that life is going to wear out

683
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,480
and there are all sorts of problems, disease, change and misfortune and

684
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,016
you get depressed. And then in order to feel happy, you eat

685
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:22,540
when you don't need to eat.

686
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,790
Then you begin to get obesity and indigestion

687
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:34,290
and wonder why the possession of all this great food isn't doing

688
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,510
anything for you, it's supposed to.

689
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:42,178
And so in the same way with. With property of all kinds,

690
00:47:42,274 --> 00:47:46,610
when it is used to get the thing that

691
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:49,874
you look forward to in the future and don't seem to have now,

692
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:54,508
it becomes a complete delusion and

693
00:47:54,564 --> 00:47:57,852
you can't understand because you think that the possession of these things ought to make

694
00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:01,292
you happy. The admin have persuaded you

695
00:48:01,316 --> 00:48:03,724
that if you could get this kind of car, this kind of yacht, this kind

696
00:48:03,732 --> 00:48:06,972
of house, this kind of scene, whatever it may

697
00:48:06,996 --> 00:48:10,200
be, you should. That that's the thing in life, that's what's important.

698
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,972
And it doesn't make people happy at all. And then they wonder why it doesn't

699
00:48:15,036 --> 00:48:19,520
and feel cheated and they have to go to psychoanalysts

700
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:25,574
and churches and things like that to. To be persuaded

701
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:29,670
that it's coming. Sometime, somehow the thing

702
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:33,170
that is always seems to be missing. And there's nothing missing at all.

703
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:38,166
Except, I mean, supposing you're absolutely starved and you just don't

704
00:48:38,198 --> 00:48:42,102
have the normal flow of energy through your organism. Then of course you

705
00:48:42,126 --> 00:48:45,536
need food, or if you're freezing,

706
00:48:45,568 --> 00:48:49,008
you need shelter. But in the ordinary way, when you are

707
00:48:49,064 --> 00:48:52,180
fed and sheltered, there isn't anything missing.

708
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,928
It's all here, but nobody is

709
00:48:56,984 --> 00:49:00,256
here to see it. Everybody is wandering

710
00:49:00,288 --> 00:49:02,340
after something else in the distance.

711
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,840
And of course this is preeminently true with

712
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,634
two other aspects of life. I've discussed housing,

713
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:14,922
furniture and clothing. But more specifically,

714
00:49:15,066 --> 00:49:18,874
food in the white Anglo Saxon

715
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:23,482
Protestant culture is unbelievably bad when

716
00:49:23,506 --> 00:49:27,226
you consider it, by and large. The reason being that we eat

717
00:49:27,258 --> 00:49:28,950
food because it's good for us.

718
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:36,980
And that's a dreadful thing to do because it

719
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,612
means that you look at the

720
00:49:40,636 --> 00:49:44,932
food from the point of view of abstract dietetics

721
00:49:45,076 --> 00:49:47,880
rather than concrete taste.

722
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,700
And wherever dietitians get interfering with

723
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:59,716
cooking that is utterly destroyed in

724
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,040
every university,

725
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:06,490
in every university from coast to coast,

726
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:09,850
where you would think would be centers of culture.

727
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:14,342
The institutional food is unbelievably

728
00:50:14,406 --> 00:50:17,590
abominable and the,

729
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:21,430
the scholars are ashamed to come out about it

730
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:24,870
because, and protest and, and lay down the law

731
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:27,818
because they're supposed to be devoted to higher things.

732
00:50:28,014 --> 00:50:30,866
And after all, what you eat just so long as it's got the right chemicals

733
00:50:30,898 --> 00:50:34,498
in, it isn't very important what this is.

734
00:50:34,554 --> 00:50:38,642
You see, the trouble with that is two things to

735
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:42,082
eat in order to live. Sort of that it's good for

736
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:45,410
you. What do you mean,

737
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:48,962
good for you? It means that it helps you to go on into the

738
00:50:48,986 --> 00:50:49,550
future.

739
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:56,146
But what is the point of going on into the future when

740
00:50:56,298 --> 00:50:58,190
all the meals ahead of you,

741
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:02,754
these unappetizing things, are just gonna enable you

742
00:51:02,762 --> 00:51:04,030
to go on into the future?

743
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:09,522
And the second thing is that eating in this spirit

744
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:13,346
is very disrespectful to all the creatures you have killed

745
00:51:13,378 --> 00:51:17,710
in order to eat. It's even disrespectful to an onion to

746
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:22,146
eat it improperly. Onions are living creatures.

747
00:51:22,258 --> 00:51:25,682
And if you cut up an onion for. For dinner, you should reverence the

748
00:51:25,706 --> 00:51:29,234
onion, you should respect it. Because if you don't

749
00:51:29,282 --> 00:51:33,106
have a feeling of love for the onion, for the fish, for whatever

750
00:51:33,138 --> 00:51:36,350
you eat, you won't cook it properly and you won't enjoy it.

751
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:41,470
Cooking is a process of loving and.

752
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:46,594
And it is a paying of. Of respect to these marvelous beings

753
00:51:46,722 --> 00:51:49,110
which we ingest in order to go on living.

754
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,676
So this entirely futuristic dietetic attitude

755
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:58,892
to food is again, you see, a question of

756
00:51:58,996 --> 00:52:02,492
purely quantitative thinking, of lack of relation to

757
00:52:02,516 --> 00:52:05,804
the material world. I may make

758
00:52:05,892 --> 00:52:09,200
one other rather important aspect of life as lovemaking.

759
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:15,350
Here again is a subject entirely neglected in our education from

760
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:18,966
any practical point of view. I mean, a lot of theoretical works,

761
00:52:19,078 --> 00:52:23,110
some of which are fantastic and grotesque as

762
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:28,390
a fine art. When you compare what

763
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:31,622
goes on in most bedrooms with the things that are suggested in the Kama

764
00:52:31,686 --> 00:52:35,850
Sutra, the difference is amazing.

765
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:42,128
That there could be a real great art as

766
00:52:42,184 --> 00:52:45,680
between lovers, husbands and wives and so on is

767
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,408
something, again, that we don't consider. Because once again,

768
00:52:49,544 --> 00:52:51,260
although sex is fun,

769
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,064
we. We go about it not really because we enjoy it.

770
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:59,060
We can't admit that, but it's good for us. It's a healthy outlet.

771
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,180
And also it's necessary, of course, for having children.

772
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,620
And that's also something for the future.

773
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,048
The existence, the physical universe is

774
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:32,420
basically playful. There is no necessity for it whatsoever.

775
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:36,950
It isn't going anywhere. That is to say,

776
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:40,198
it doesn't have

777
00:53:40,254 --> 00:53:43,090
some destination that it ought to arrive at,

778
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:47,490
but that it is best understood by analogy with music.

779
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:54,854
Because music as an art form is essentially

780
00:53:54,902 --> 00:53:58,810
playful. We say you play the piano, you don't work the piano.

781
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:02,318
Why music differs from,

782
00:54:02,374 --> 00:54:06,318
say, travel. When you travel, you are trying to get

783
00:54:06,374 --> 00:54:09,530
somewhere. In music, though,

784
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:13,490
one doesn't make the end of a Composition.

785
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:17,982
The point of the competition, of the composition, if that were so,

786
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:21,230
the best conductors would be those who played fastest and

787
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:24,712
there would be composers who wrote only finales. People go

788
00:54:24,736 --> 00:54:28,488
to concert just to hear one crashing chord because that's the end.

789
00:54:28,624 --> 00:54:32,120
Same way in dancing, you don't aim at a particular spot in the room.

790
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:40,360
That's where you should arrive. The whole point of the dancing is the dance now.

791
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,232
But we don't see that as something

792
00:54:44,336 --> 00:54:47,736
brought by our education into our everyday conduct.

793
00:54:47,928 --> 00:54:51,506
We've got a system of schooling which gives a completely

794
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,070
different impression. It's all graded.

795
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:59,122
And what we do is we put the child into the corridor of

796
00:54:59,146 --> 00:55:02,066
this grade system with a kind of come on, kitty, kitty,

797
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:05,730
kitty. And now you go to kindergarten, you know, and that's a great thing

798
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:09,922
because when you finish that, you'll get into first grade and

799
00:55:09,946 --> 00:55:12,802
then, come on, first grade leads to second grade and so on. And then you

800
00:55:12,826 --> 00:55:15,842
get out of grade school, you've got high school and it's revving up. The thing

801
00:55:15,866 --> 00:55:19,254
is coming. Then you're going to go to college and by Jove, then you get

802
00:55:19,262 --> 00:55:22,278
into graduate school. And when you're through with graduate school,

803
00:55:22,334 --> 00:55:26,118
you go out to join the world and then you get into some

804
00:55:26,174 --> 00:55:30,038
racket where you're selling insurance and they've got that quota

805
00:55:30,054 --> 00:55:33,302
to make and you're going to make that. And all the time the thing

806
00:55:33,326 --> 00:55:36,342
is coming, it's coming, it's coming, that great thing,

807
00:55:36,446 --> 00:55:39,638
the success you're working for. Then when you wake up one day about 40

808
00:55:39,694 --> 00:55:42,570
years old, you say, my God, I've arrived,

809
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,864
I'm there. And you don't feel very different from what

810
00:55:46,872 --> 00:55:48,020
you always felt.

811
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,312
Look at the people who live to retire and

812
00:55:53,336 --> 00:55:57,600
put those savings away. And then when they 65,

813
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:01,500
they don't have any energy left. They're more or less impotent and

814
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,900
they go and rot in an old people's senior citizens community.

815
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:13,190
Because we've simply cheated ourselves the whole way down the line.

816
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:19,322
We thought of life by analogy with a journey,

817
00:56:19,466 --> 00:56:23,002
with a pilgrimage which had a serious purpose at the end. And the thing

818
00:56:23,026 --> 00:56:26,810
was to get to that end. Success or whatever it is, or maybe heaven

819
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:27,990
after your death.

820
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:40,412
But we missed the point. The whole way along it

821
00:56:40,436 --> 00:56:44,044
was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the

822
00:56:44,052 --> 00:56:45,400
music was being played.

823
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:04,406
Courage of star before

824
00:57:04,558 --> 00:57:09,010
you left. How light

825
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:15,130
carries on endlessly

826
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:19,250
even after death.

827
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:24,406
The shortness of

828
00:57:24,478 --> 00:57:28,420
brightness. I'll explain

829
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,860
the infinite.

830
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,580
How rare and beautiful

831
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,600
it truly is that

832
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,300
we exist.

833
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:12,138
That is a way of demonstrating the Basic experience,

834
00:58:12,274 --> 00:58:15,706
which underlies some of the major forms of Oriental

835
00:58:15,738 --> 00:58:18,966
philosophy. And actually this way of

836
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:22,934
demonstrating it is taken from a kind of Chinese and Japanese

837
00:58:22,982 --> 00:58:26,438
Buddhism called Zen, which I'm going to be talking about quite

838
00:58:26,454 --> 00:58:30,806
a bit today, because Zen is one of the best examples

839
00:58:30,998 --> 00:58:34,022
of a philosophy, shall we call it,

840
00:58:34,126 --> 00:58:36,970
in which this experience is dominant.

841
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:42,900
Zen, of course, is a Japanese word and it's

842
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,100
spelled Z, E, N,

843
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,560
and that is the Japanese way of pronouncing the Chinese word

844
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,540
chan.

845
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,512
And this in turn is the Chinese way of pronouncing an

846
00:59:02,536 --> 00:59:05,460
Indian Sanskrit word, yana.

847
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:13,230
And Dhyana refers

848
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:17,370
to the kind of experience which has been

849
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:21,290
represented in this circle. Another word for it would

850
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:25,430
be a third, a second Sanskrit term,

851
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:28,830
shunya.

852
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:35,410
And the nearest we can translate shunya is in English,

853
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,450
is emptiness or void.

854
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:44,190
And so we might say this is an experience of

855
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:48,170
the void before

856
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:51,998
trying to explain what this is. And, you know, the funny

857
00:59:52,014 --> 00:59:54,814
thing is it really can't be explained because it has to be felt,

858
00:59:54,942 --> 00:59:58,734
because it's a transformation of one's basic feeling, one's basic

859
00:59:58,782 --> 01:00:03,060
consciousness of life. But I should mention first

860
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,340
that it is characteristic of Eastern philosophy

861
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,320
to be based on experience rather than ideas.

862
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,780
You see, philosophy in the Western world,

863
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,088
especially as it's taught in our universities and academies,

864
01:00:18,264 --> 01:00:21,608
is mainly a matter of thinking. It's a matter

865
01:00:21,664 --> 01:00:24,760
of trying to arrive at certain clear,

866
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,370
positive ideas, ideas about the nature of man,

867
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:31,510
the nature of the universe, and so on and so forth.

868
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:35,586
And also, religion in the west is somewhat similar because religion

869
01:00:35,618 --> 01:00:39,270
is largely concerned with belief in certain ideas.

870
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:44,434
In these basic forms of Eastern philosophy, on the other hand, such as Zen,

871
01:00:44,482 --> 01:00:48,482
which is a kind of Buddhism or Taoism, the basic

872
01:00:48,546 --> 01:00:52,224
native philosophy of China, or in Venice, Vedanta,

873
01:00:52,272 --> 01:00:55,380
which is the central form of Indian philosophy.

874
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,660
What is basic to them is not ideas,

875
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,380
but a way of experiencing, a way of feeling.

876
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:08,416
And this might be called, as it is here, the void

877
01:01:08,608 --> 01:01:10,900
demonstrated by the circle,

878
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:15,860
because it is not a void which is just emptiness.

879
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,648
This isn't the idea that there are people

880
01:01:19,784 --> 01:01:23,840
in the backward world of the backward worlds of Asia who

881
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,740
think that the universe is ultimately nothing at all.

882
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,672
It is rather that the void represents

883
01:01:32,816 --> 01:01:36,160
complete spiritual freedom. Or you might

884
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,032
say, if you don't like the word spiritual, complete psychological

885
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:45,012
freedom. And therefore I

886
01:01:45,036 --> 01:01:48,532
want to try, if I can, to communicate to

887
01:01:48,556 --> 01:01:52,388
you, to give you some idea of what this experience

888
01:01:52,524 --> 01:01:56,840
is in Japanese. In Zen it is called satori.

889
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:00,840
I'll write that down. It's an unfamiliar word,

890
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:06,560
S A T O R

891
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:10,142
I. And I

892
01:02:10,166 --> 01:02:14,050
like the way that that's pronounced in Southern Chinese.

893
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:21,950
They pronounce it because

894
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:25,330
it's something that happens to you suddenly.

895
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:29,570
Now, let me try, if I can possibly,

896
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:34,740
to put into some sort of words what this experience is.

897
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:39,576
This experience which, so far as they are concerned,

898
01:02:39,768 --> 01:02:42,888
is the objective of human

899
01:02:42,944 --> 01:02:47,160
life. To get this is

900
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:51,432
to understand the meaning of human nature and destiny

901
01:02:51,576 --> 01:02:54,840
only because it's a transformation of consciousness, because it's something

902
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,960
you feel rather than something you think. It is, for this reason,

903
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,710
difficult to put into words. But it is as if

904
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:05,250
you saw quite suddenly, and indeed this

905
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:08,690
experience could have happened to you. It can

906
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:12,274
come without warning to anybody. And so what I'm going to be saying

907
01:03:12,442 --> 01:03:15,842
may strike a familiar ring in some ears, but it

908
01:03:15,866 --> 01:03:20,114
is as if quite suddenly, you became totally

909
01:03:20,162 --> 01:03:24,002
convinced that the way everything

910
01:03:24,106 --> 01:03:28,972
is in this universe and at this moment is

911
01:03:29,076 --> 01:03:32,668
absolutely right. And that's almost putting

912
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:36,220
it too weakly. I'm not trying to talk about

913
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:39,580
a sort of Pollyanna feeling where we say, well,

914
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:43,180
this is the best of all possible worlds, and everything, however evil and

915
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:47,068
however wrong, is going to work out all right in the end, because it's a

916
01:03:47,204 --> 01:03:50,600
means to an end in some master design. I'm not saying that.

917
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:56,390
I'm saying it is suddenly feeling that

918
01:03:56,510 --> 01:04:00,198
everything is right the way

919
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:03,910
it is now, however appalling,

920
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:07,410
however terrible, and you know it

921
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:10,330
beyond a shadow of doubt.

922
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:17,490
There are two other aspects to this experience as well,

923
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:21,560
and although you feel them all together, we have to talk about them separately.

924
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:26,244
While the first aspect is feeling that everything, just as it is,

925
01:04:26,332 --> 01:04:29,524
is so right that you could say of it,

926
01:04:29,612 --> 01:04:33,200
this is why I'm alive. This is what life's all about.

927
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:37,844
The second is that everything you see and feel seems

928
01:04:37,892 --> 01:04:41,092
to come to life in an extraordinary way. You feel the world as you've seen

929
01:04:41,116 --> 01:04:44,582
it before was seen almost in a dream, but it

930
01:04:44,606 --> 01:04:47,878
is as if just the ordinary things that were confronting you suddenly went

931
01:04:47,934 --> 01:04:49,770
yah. And came alive.

932
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:55,414
And the third aspect of it is that you no longer

933
01:04:55,462 --> 01:04:59,382
feel yourself and what you are experiencing

934
01:04:59,526 --> 01:05:03,430
to be separated. Although you don't lose

935
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:06,982
the feeling of the outline of your skin. You don't forget

936
01:05:07,046 --> 01:05:10,502
that I, or Joe Doak is a possible name by

937
01:05:10,526 --> 01:05:14,406
which you can refer to yourself. Nevertheless, it suddenly

938
01:05:14,438 --> 01:05:18,022
seems to you that your skin is no longer what divides you from

939
01:05:18,046 --> 01:05:22,214
the world. It's what joins you to it. What you see outside you

940
01:05:22,302 --> 01:05:25,782
is also you. Now, we ordinarily

941
01:05:25,846 --> 01:05:29,382
restrict the idea of ego,

942
01:05:29,446 --> 01:05:32,582
of inus or of unis, to some

943
01:05:32,606 --> 01:05:35,888
sort of psychological entity or

944
01:05:35,944 --> 01:05:39,020
process inside us which is in control of things.

945
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:44,100
And we identify ourselves with a sort of controlling center.

946
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,624
But in this experience, it is as if that center was suddenly

947
01:05:50,672 --> 01:05:53,060
enlarged to include the whole universe.

948
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:58,384
You almost feel as if you were God. Except that in

949
01:05:58,472 --> 01:06:02,462
Eastern thought, one doesn't think. Think of God as a kind of omnipotent

950
01:06:02,526 --> 01:06:06,590
person. I mean, there are lots of people in our asylums

951
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:10,526
who say, well, I'm God. I was like the story of the woman who insisted

952
01:06:10,558 --> 01:06:14,062
that she was God. And to humor her, someone said, well, if you're God,

953
01:06:14,126 --> 01:06:17,690
will you please explain how you managed to create the universe in six days?

954
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:22,366
She said, I never talk shop. It isn't

955
01:06:22,398 --> 01:06:25,490
feeling God in that sense as if you could do anything.

956
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:30,504
But it is feeling that you and

957
01:06:30,592 --> 01:06:32,900
this whole world are one.

958
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,992
And that in this experience of oneness

959
01:06:38,056 --> 01:06:42,472
and the sudden coming alive of everything. And the profound

960
01:06:42,616 --> 01:06:46,360
rightness. That's the only word I can use. The profound rightness of

961
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,624
each moment, of this moment, however far it may

962
01:06:49,712 --> 01:06:52,790
seem to be, short of one's ideals of perfection,

963
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:54,830
this is it.

964
01:06:56,730 --> 01:07:00,370
And you say, having seen this, I can

965
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:04,350
die content. This is what it was all about.

966
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:14,350
Underneath it all, there's this vast realm of

967
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:18,754
conscious presence. There is a presence there without which

968
01:07:18,842 --> 01:07:22,438
you wouldn't be able to perceive anything. You wouldn't be able

969
01:07:22,494 --> 01:07:26,450
to think anything. It's a little bit like

970
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:30,230
I compare it sometimes to before you

971
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:33,574
live on the surface of the ocean. You are a little ripple on

972
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:36,886
the surface of the ocean. And this ripple

973
01:07:36,918 --> 01:07:39,210
only knows itself as a ripple.

974
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:43,606
And it looks at other ripples and

975
01:07:43,678 --> 01:07:47,494
sometimes feels threatened by other ripples. Or wants to use other ripples

976
01:07:47,542 --> 01:07:51,596
to enhance its own sense of self. And it's always fearful.

977
01:07:51,788 --> 01:07:54,640
It always compares itself to other ripples.

978
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:58,520
A very unpleasant and frustrating way to live.

979
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:03,196
It hasn't realized the depth of its being

980
01:08:03,348 --> 01:08:07,324
because the ripple is only a temporary expression of the vastness

981
01:08:07,372 --> 01:08:10,760
of the ocean. But it doesn't know that.

982
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:14,514
So if the ripple for a moment comes to us, if the.

983
01:08:14,652 --> 01:08:18,166
The continuous thought. In this analogy,

984
01:08:18,358 --> 01:08:22,470
the ripple, of course, is the human being and

985
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:26,330
the ripple. When the ripple stops thinking for a moment,

986
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:30,570
and this is the key, for a moment,

987
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:34,758
you come to a cessation of the stream of thinking.

988
01:08:34,934 --> 01:08:38,886
And what's left when you're not thinking about your

989
01:08:39,038 --> 01:08:42,372
history, your personal history or

990
01:08:42,396 --> 01:08:46,548
the future, you're just becoming aware of this

991
01:08:46,604 --> 01:08:50,644
moment, yourself, this moment.

992
01:08:50,692 --> 01:08:54,500
But what is that self? It's no longer the historical

993
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:57,680
self. You can't say very much about it.

994
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:01,972
There is an underlying sense of presence,

995
01:09:02,116 --> 01:09:04,520
of alive, conscious presence.

996
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:07,560
It's still but still alive.

997
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:11,792
The awakening can begin with

998
01:09:11,976 --> 01:09:15,200
realizing that you are not the thoughts that go through

999
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:18,640
your mind. That's the beginning. Now what has

1000
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:21,460
arisen at that moment? Awareness.

1001
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:26,656
Suddenly you realize that there is a dimension

1002
01:09:26,688 --> 01:09:31,360
of consciousness in you that's not thinking but

1003
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:36,030
just conscious. And that is your essence identity

1004
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:40,634
to be rooted in that. It's ultimately

1005
01:09:40,682 --> 01:09:43,626
very simple. I don't know why they don't teach that at school.

1006
01:09:43,778 --> 01:09:47,930
I mean, the most important life lesson is

1007
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:51,482
the transcendent dimension of life of who you

1008
01:09:51,506 --> 01:09:55,866
are. To find all the ancient teachings using

1009
01:09:55,938 --> 01:09:59,482
different terms and different words. They all point

1010
01:09:59,586 --> 01:10:03,914
to, to this possibility of realizing the transcendent

1011
01:10:03,962 --> 01:10:07,770
dimension of who you are. Whether the

1012
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:11,402
Buddha calls it, the Buddha actually calls it.

1013
01:10:11,586 --> 01:10:14,990
The translation is sunyata, emptiness.

1014
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:20,190
But better translation would be spaciousness.

1015
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,466
That's the essence of who you are, Sunyatta,

1016
01:10:23,498 --> 01:10:28,082
spaciousness. Jesus talks about the

1017
01:10:28,106 --> 01:10:31,650
kingdom of heaven, which in my translation is

1018
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:35,362
not. I translated kingdom, I translated

1019
01:10:35,426 --> 01:10:39,570
as dimension and heaven, which is the

1020
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:42,770
vast heaven. When you look up at the sky,

1021
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:46,674
that's the closest thing you can get to spaciousness in

1022
01:10:46,682 --> 01:10:50,562
the sense perceived world. The closest thing you can get to spatience.

1023
01:10:50,626 --> 01:10:54,460
The look at the vastness of the sky or heaven. In many languages

1024
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:58,060
heaven and sky is the same word. So you look at the

1025
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:01,756
vastness of sky, which is vast, spaciousness.

1026
01:11:01,948 --> 01:11:06,748
So the kingdom of heaven is the dimension of spaciousness.

1027
01:11:06,844 --> 01:11:10,764
It's a dimension of consciousness. This is why then they asked Jesus,

1028
01:11:10,812 --> 01:11:13,480
where is the kingdom of heaven? When is it going to come?

1029
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:17,584
And he said, the kingdom of heaven cannot come with

1030
01:11:17,672 --> 01:11:21,408
science to be perceived. You can never say it's over here or it's

1031
01:11:21,424 --> 01:11:25,340
over there, because kingdom of heaven is within you.

1032
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,580
In fact, he was saying it is the essence of who you are.

1033
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:33,760
Consciousness is. But it's not only the essence of who you are, it's the

1034
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,688
essence of the universe itself. Because you are,

1035
01:11:36,824 --> 01:11:39,940
you are just a microcosm of the universe.

1036
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:44,446
So when you realize the essence of who you are, the universe is real,

1037
01:11:44,608 --> 01:11:48,626
its own essence through you. This little thing through

1038
01:11:48,698 --> 01:11:49,310
you.

1039
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:03,154
The ideas of Alan Watts and Eckhart Tolle are fundamental

1040
01:12:03,202 --> 01:12:07,474
contributions to the wisdom on this channel. But the animations displayed

1041
01:12:07,522 --> 01:12:11,164
here are merely the tip of the iceberg. If you want to dive

1042
01:12:11,212 --> 01:12:15,116
