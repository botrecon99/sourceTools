1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,992
The very fact that you are here at all to

2
00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:09,900
listen to this sort of thing indicates,

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,060
as all philosophy indicates, that there is some unrest,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,740
that to be a human being is in some way problematic,

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,100
that there is such a thing as a life problem,

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,940
and different people have different ways of expressing it.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,064
But there is the reality of what is called in Buddhism,

8
00:00:34,192 --> 00:00:37,648
dukkha, a very comprehensive word,

9
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:41,488
generally translated suffering, but which

10
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:45,620
might more accurately be called chronic frustration.

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,536
And I, first of all, want to try and identify what this human

12
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:55,092
problem is. And we start out from

13
00:00:55,116 --> 00:00:58,516
the fact that most of us have a puzzle

14
00:00:58,548 --> 00:01:01,940
with ourselves, not so much with other

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,280
people, but oneself.

16
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,972
Lots of people say that they do various things, like go to the

17
00:01:09,996 --> 00:01:13,636
movies or get absorbed in work or read novels

18
00:01:13,748 --> 00:01:17,124
in order to forget themselves. It's very commonly

19
00:01:17,172 --> 00:01:19,400
said, I want to get away from myself.

20
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,412
And when we are left alone with ourselves in silence and there

21
00:01:24,436 --> 00:01:27,580
is no distraction, civilized people, whether they

22
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,652
belong to the Eastern cultures or the Western cultures, tend to

23
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:34,800
feel uncomfortable. This is especially true of Americans,

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,380
who like to live in an environment of constant noise and

25
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,640
to keep their minds busy.

26
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,600
What is so much the matter with oneself that you can't stand it?

27
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,000
Well, first of all, we don't know what it is.

28
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,080
Yourself is the most difficult thing to get a look at,

29
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,520
because in just the same way that you cannot bite your own teeth,

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,000
that you cannot look straight into your eyes without the aid of a mirror,

31
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,520
that you are not apparently directly aware of your brain

32
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,640
for all this reason, yourself is too close to you for you to look at.

33
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,058
And it always remains an unknown, a kind of a blind spot in the middle

34
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,562
of everything. What color is

35
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:26,470
your head to your eyes?

36
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,706
Most people have a vague impression that behind the eyes there is a

37
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,986
blank. It isn't black, it certainly isn't

38
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:39,790
white, and you can turn around for all you're worth and never see it.

39
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,306
What is behind the eyes? We don't

40
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:47,914
know, but we have ideas

41
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:51,242
about it. And the dominant

42
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:55,098
idea which most people have is that there is something called

43
00:02:55,154 --> 00:02:57,590
I. When you use the word I,

44
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,510
to what sensation do you refer?

45
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,790
In what way do you experience I as something existing?

46
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,818
Well, I've made a great deal of inquiries into this and

47
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:14,790
looking at it from the way most people talk,

48
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,250
they think of I myself as

49
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,730
a center of awareness and

50
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,026
of action, about halfway

51
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:30,990
between the ears and a little way behind the eyes.

52
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,650
Most people don't identify I myself with their

53
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,010
whole body. Because we say

54
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,374
in popular speech, I have a body, we are

55
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:45,450
not liable to say, I am a body.

56
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,982
We don't Feel that certain things that go on in

57
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:54,222
our bodies are things for which I, ego, am responsible.

58
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:56,490
We don't say I beat my heart.

59
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,790
We don't say I grow my hair. Because we

60
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,550
experience the beating of the heart and the growing of the hair as something

61
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,810
that happens to us.

62
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,680
We feel our bodies are vehicles, like cars which

63
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,800
were given to us by our parents and into which,

64
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,416
at some point in our development, the ego

65
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:21,500
was deposited.

66
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,976
Pop, when did you begin

67
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:29,860
to be you? All sorts of theories about that.

68
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,860
But generally speaking, I think of myself

69
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,190
as the source of voluntary action and

70
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,206
of conscious attention. And therefore

71
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:47,414
outside myself as I, both inside the body and definitely

72
00:04:47,462 --> 00:04:51,330
outside the skin. Everything else is experienced as not I,

73
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,510
as other, as being very largely beyond

74
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:59,462
control and as in a way alien

75
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:03,248
to me. In the words of the poet Haussmann,

76
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:07,580
I, a stranger and afraid in a world I never made.

77
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,980
And here lies the root of problems,

78
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,660
because it appears that

79
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,380
I isn't really very permanent.

80
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,704
At least it's messed up with or mixed up with a body that grows

81
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:30,260
old and gets achy and inconvenient

82
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,540
and finally dissolves. Then what's going to happen to me?

83
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,300
Maybe I'm not afraid of actual death.

84
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,840
Especially if I believe that death is simply extinction,

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,940
total unconsciousness. There's nothing to be afraid of in that.

86
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,980
But it's the process of dying that's so inconvenient.

87
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,580
One is so hard to get rid of.

88
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,840
And so why, I mean, why am I trapped in this

89
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,312
situation? I didn't ask to

90
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:08,140
come here.

91
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,700
We say in popular speech, I came into this world.

92
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,744
We experience this world as other than ourselves, in the

93
00:06:19,752 --> 00:06:23,866
sense that we say, you confront reality out there.

94
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:27,738
You must face facts out there. And facts

95
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,850
are always, of course, hard facts. Nobody ever talks about soft facts,

96
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,430
but there are lots of them.

97
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,114
So this sensation of. We could call it generally of alienation

98
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:42,510
from the universe.

99
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,830
Now, of course, it isn't true that you came into this world.

100
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,012
You came out of it as

101
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:56,964
leaves come out of a tree, as a baby comes out of the

102
00:06:56,972 --> 00:07:00,560
womb. You're a symptom of the world

103
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,596
in the same way that when a tree produces

104
00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:07,160
apples, you call it an apple tree.

105
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,164
And a world that produces people is a

106
00:07:12,172 --> 00:07:15,440
world that peoples just as an apple tree, apples.

107
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,492
In fact, our whole situation of feeling that we are

108
00:07:20,516 --> 00:07:26,300
strangers in the earth is a hallucination and

109
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,772
a rather dangerous hallucination because it

110
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:33,740
moves us to act upon the external world, both of people and

111
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,880
of things, in a hostile spirit.

112
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,160
So that we talk about the conquest of nature.

113
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,838
And this General feeling of resentment of being

114
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:51,470
involved. In a world where there are such

115
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,370
things as death, disease,

116
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,250
accidents, strife,

117
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,570
war, we feel put upon.

118
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,652
So the

119
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:12,444
various forms of Asian philosophy address

120
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:14,440
themselves directly to this problem,

121
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,372
but they are not like philosophy in the west,

122
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:21,800
and they are not like religion in the West.

123
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,920
If religion is something like Judaism or Christianity,

124
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,880
then Buddhism is not a religion.

125
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,278
If philosophy is something like the speculations

126
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:40,902
of Kant or Hegel or

127
00:08:41,006 --> 00:08:45,062
even modern philosophers such

128
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:46,970
as Ayer and Reichenbach,

129
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,090
then Eastern thought is not philosophy.

130
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,830
The nearest thing to Eastern philosophy in the west is

131
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,184
psychotherapy, because the objective

132
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:05,072
of psychotherapy is to change the way in

133
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:08,912
which people feel. It is,

134
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:12,288
in other words, a technique for changing one's

135
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:15,856
state of consciousness. And so in exactly

136
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,168
that way, these systems that I'm going to talk to you about,

137
00:09:19,304 --> 00:09:22,576
Hinduism, Buddhism and Daoism are primarily

138
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:26,350
methods for changing one state of consciousness.

139
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,418
If, for example, a person is crazy and feels that

140
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:35,670
he is the center of an enormous plot to persecute him,

141
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,042
the object of the psychotherapist is to disabuse him

142
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:43,630
of this illusion and get rid of his state of fear.

143
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,594
So, in a rather similar way, let us suppose

144
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,566
that normal people are simply

145
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:56,974
sharing a collective insanity,

146
00:09:57,102 --> 00:10:00,670
which, because it's normal, they think is the. Is the ordinary way to

147
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,918
be. It is perfectly clear,

148
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:06,450
I think, that the world is insane,

149
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,930
that we are on a collision course,

150
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,374
and that therefore there is something to be said for the idea

151
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:18,970
that the normal person's state of consciousness might do with a change,

152
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,534
especially if it's a hallucination, and especially

153
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:26,702
if the way we feel our own

154
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:30,910
existence is in flat contradiction to

155
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,406
the way our existence would be described by a scientist,

156
00:10:35,598 --> 00:10:39,342
such as a biologist or an ecologist or a

157
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:43,250
physicist. You know, I think ecology

158
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,998
is a very important science having to do with the relationship between organisms

159
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:52,026
and their environments. Now, when an ecologist

160
00:10:52,058 --> 00:10:54,670
or a biologist looks at a living organism,

161
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,150
the business of science is to describe what's happening.

162
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,990
And he describes the living organism.

163
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,650
He finds out a very funny thing. He cannot describe

164
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,122
the organism defined as

165
00:11:12,146 --> 00:11:16,384
something bounded by an epidermis without

166
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:20,080
also describing its environment. See,

167
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,980
science describes behavior. What is going on?

168
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,360
The man behind the microscope has this advice for you. Instead of

169
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,460
asking what it is, just ask, what does it do?

170
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,552
So the behavior of an organism cannot be

171
00:11:37,576 --> 00:11:41,180
described without also describing the behavior of the environment.

172
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,882
If I describe somebody in the act of walking and

173
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:49,562
I say nothing about the floor or the area, the room

174
00:11:49,586 --> 00:11:53,706
or whatever in which he's walking, all I'm describing is a body

175
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:56,350
in empty Space dangling its legs.

176
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,746
Well, that's not walking. To describe walking,

177
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:04,010
I have to describe the other behaviors or

178
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,322
processes going on around the organism. Well, what does that

179
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:09,030
tell me when I find that out?

180
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,128
It tells me that what I am talking about is

181
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:17,552
not the organism alone, but something for which

182
00:12:17,576 --> 00:12:20,940
we've got only the clumsy term organism, environment.

183
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,260
Because, you see, that's what you are.

184
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,020
Imagine. How could you feel the existence of yourself

185
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,420
unless at the same time you felt something other?

186
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,612
How could you espy any kind of figure,

187
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:42,920
shape, form, unless at the same time you saw its background?

188
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,412
Supposing the outlines of my body were coterminous with your

189
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:50,880
whole field of vision. You wouldn't see me,

190
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,692
you'd see the microphone, the neck, tie or

191
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:58,100
pattern on the shirt. That would be the thing you were looking at.

192
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,800
Because you can only recognize anything if it goes along with the background,

193
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,210
which is telling us that figure and ground are

194
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,066
inseparable. They're different.

195
00:13:10,138 --> 00:13:13,170
Yes. You have to get

196
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,930
the crucial idea of things being different but

197
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:17,910
inseparable.

198
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,970
As, for example, the two poles of a magnet are

199
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,830
inseparable. You can't have a one pole magnet,

200
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,580
but they're different. The two sides of a coin

201
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,700
are different, but inseparable.

202
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,660
And so there is a word that I've coined called go with.

203
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,980
There are certain things that go with each other,

204
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,740
and the organism goes with the environment.

205
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,866
And incidentally, the environment goes with the organism.

206
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:57,330
That's harder for us to see, but I shall explain it in due course.

207
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,050
A go withness is a transaction.

208
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,046
For example, when we buy and sell, that is a transaction.

209
00:14:07,238 --> 00:14:10,970
Now, obviously you can't buy unless somebody is selling,

210
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,782
and you can't sell unless someone is buying. The operations

211
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:19,690
are different. Buying is different from selling, but they're inseparable.

212
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,100
And that suggests a certain kind of conspiracy between them.

213
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,840
They're explicitly different operations,

214
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,180
buying and selling, but they're implicitly one.

215
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,816
You and everything you call other are explicitly

216
00:14:38,848 --> 00:14:42,304
different. But since you always find

217
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:45,872
these two aspects of experience together, there's a. There's a kind of

218
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:49,142
something fishy about it that

219
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,130
isn't noticed, that's been overlooked,

220
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,210
and that is that they're implicitly one.

221
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,182
But you see, in the ordinary course of events, as I've explained, we are not

222
00:15:00,206 --> 00:15:03,414
aware of this. And we think that everything,

223
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,726
not self, or in other words, other,

224
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:10,330
is not merely different from us, but separate.

225
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,250
Therefore have this sense of not really belonging in this universe,

226
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,352
of finding nature a problem. And that's compounded by the

227
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:22,700
current superstitions of the modern world.

228
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,312
The mythology of 19th century science, which is everybody's common sense

229
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:31,380
today, that the world itself is stupid.

230
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,464
That it's a huge system of electronic

231
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:39,860
energy buzzing mindlessly,

232
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,820
in which we exist by virtue of some statistical flukes.

233
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,838
You know that if a million monkeys sat with a million typewriters for a million

234
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:50,770
years, in some course,

235
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,130
someday they would type out the Encyclopedia Britannica.

236
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,530
They'd eventually have to get around to it by just chance.

237
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,910
So there's the feeling among many people that what we are at this moment is

238
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,010
just such an event.

239
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,530
And that therefore, if we are going to maintain the human order,

240
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,030
our values, our reason, our civilization,

241
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,990
we've got to fight the world to maintain it.

242
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:22,762
Because the world is stupid. So in the

243
00:16:22,786 --> 00:16:26,970
philosophy of science in the 19th century, you hear

244
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:31,674
people talking about energy lying

245
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:36,198
behind matter as blind energy. Freud defines

246
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:40,382
psychic energy as the unconscious. And furthermore calls it libido,

247
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:44,094
which means blind lust. It's stupid. The unconscious

248
00:16:44,142 --> 00:16:47,582
is stupid. It wants pleasure and has

249
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:51,342
no sense of reality. And therefore Freud

250
00:16:51,406 --> 00:16:55,250
would oppose the pleasure principle to the reality principle.

251
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,610
And therefore, civilization is always thought of as

252
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,982
being against pleasure. Because if you let people enjoy themselves too

253
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:07,696
much, they'll fall apart. Because the pleasure principle,

254
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:10,500
the pleasure urge, is stupid by definition.

255
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,112
So you see, then we have the sensation of living in

256
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,340
an alien world.

257
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,232
All this is further complicated by other factors which I must now go on

258
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:24,100
to explain.

259
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,384
The feeling of insularity, of being I,

260
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:33,848
alone and separate, has something

261
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:37,192
to do with the way in which we pay attention

262
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,020
to life.

263
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,320
And with the way in which we think about it. And these two things go

264
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,880
together. The task of any school teacher

265
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,416
with little children is to increase,

266
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:54,552
isn't it, their attention?

267
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:59,100
Spanish little children are

268
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,876
allegedly. Although this isn't always true, little children are supposed

269
00:18:02,908 --> 00:18:05,720
not to pay attention to anything, particularly for very long.

270
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,252
They run from one thing to another. They look out of the window, they pick

271
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:13,516
their noses, they moon around. And so the teacher

272
00:18:13,548 --> 00:18:17,052
has to wrap the desk and say, pay attention. And all

273
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:19,800
the little children know exactly what's expected of them,

274
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,188
that is, to wrap their legs tightly around the legs of the chair

275
00:18:24,244 --> 00:18:26,860
and stare at the teacher with a slight frown.

276
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,936
That is, paying attention has nothing to do with paying

277
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:34,520
attention. It is simply an

278
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,624
act. But it. What it

279
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:41,256
does suggest is that we feel that paying attention or concentration

280
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:43,100
involves a certain strain.

281
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,546
You can't transform yourself. You can't

282
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:56,306
make yourself sane. You can't make yourself loving. You can't

283
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:58,150
make yourself unselfish.

284
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,950
And yet it's absolutely necessary that we be that way.

285
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,082
It's absolutely necessary if

286
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:11,874
we are going to hand over the direction

287
00:19:11,922 --> 00:19:15,390
of nature to nature. Which is what it comes to.

288
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,444
Absolutely necessary that we let go of ourselves.

289
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,300
And it can't be done. Not by

290
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,252
anything that we call doing it. Acting willing, or even just

291
00:19:28,276 --> 00:19:30,876
accepting things. You can't do it.

292
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:31,720
Why,

293
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,418
it's astonishing. All this is only 20 or

294
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:55,030
30 minutes from the heart of San Francisco.

295
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,910
Not a human habitation in sight anywhere.

296
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,890
I've been living out here for some months to

297
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,202
write and to absorb an atmosphere that

298
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:12,528
is different from the city. To try

299
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:15,140
and find out what is the essential difference.

300
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,380
Between the world of nature and the world of man.

301
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,464
Because there's an obvious difference,

302
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,392
like the difference of artistic styles. No one,

303
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,816
for example, would confuse a painting by Leonardo

304
00:20:28,848 --> 00:20:32,352
with a painting by Picasso. And in the same way, there seems to

305
00:20:32,376 --> 00:20:35,060
be a complete difference of style.

306
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,584
Between the things that human beings

307
00:20:39,632 --> 00:20:43,500
do and the things that nature does.

308
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,900
Even though human beings are themselves part of nature.

309
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,600
On the one hand, nature is

310
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,968
wiggly. Everything wiggles. The outlines

311
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:59,552
of the hills, the shapes of the

312
00:20:59,576 --> 00:21:02,842
trees, the way the

313
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:06,350
wind brushes the grass. It all wiggles.

314
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,130
And for some reason or other. We find wiggly things very

315
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,810
difficult to keep track of. And we say, well,

316
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,666
let's get things straightened out. Let's get this ironed out.

317
00:21:18,738 --> 00:21:20,550
Let's get it all squared away.

318
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,550
And then somehow we think we understand things.

319
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,818
When we have translated them

320
00:21:28,994 --> 00:21:31,750
into terms of straight lines and squares.

321
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:37,670
Maybe that's why they call rather rigid people squares.

322
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,390
But it doesn't fit nature.

323
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,322
You know, wherever human beings have been around

324
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:49,970
and done their thing, you find

325
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,510
rectangles. We live in boxes.

326
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,660
Our streets are laid out in a grid pattern.

327
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,200
Why, they even dropped a grid pattern on top of San Francisco.

328
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,204
With all those hills so that cars

329
00:22:06,252 --> 00:22:09,836
run away. Because it

330
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:13,244
seems that the human being really has a very simple

331
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:14,360
kind of mind.

332
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,600
And all this wiggliness is too complicated.

333
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,070
I don't think it really is complicated. Because, after all,

334
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,370
it's very simple to move,

335
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,902
say, to raise something. Or to open and

336
00:22:32,926 --> 00:22:36,662
close your hand. It's perfectly easy because we

337
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:40,902
don't have to think about it. Things become complicated

338
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:44,438
only when we think about them. And that's because

339
00:22:44,494 --> 00:22:48,240
we are trying to translate them into a form of life.

340
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,552
Which is very much simpler and cruder. Than the

341
00:22:51,576 --> 00:22:55,760
forms of life we're talking about. A triangle

342
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,740
is very much simpler and cruder than a mountain.

343
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,072
Even though you may represent a mountain with a

344
00:23:03,096 --> 00:23:07,552
triangle. Human beings are

345
00:23:07,576 --> 00:23:10,860
just as wiggly as nature and are brave.

346
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,820
Brains are an incredible mess of wiggles.

347
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,620
And that's the part of ourselves that we understand least of all.

348
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,736
I'm afraid the problem is partly due to Mr. Euclid, who invented geometry

349
00:23:25,928 --> 00:23:29,848
because he didn't really measure the earth. He measured and gave

350
00:23:29,864 --> 00:23:33,432
us ideas about the very simple forms in his own mind.

351
00:23:33,616 --> 00:23:37,072
And perhaps we should come to the conclusion that he really had a rather weak

352
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:40,992
speaking intellect. Because sometimes

353
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,100
when I'm in the middle of all this,

354
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,096
I feel as if I were in the middle

355
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:49,700
of an amazing brain.

356
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,344
In other words, the brain is a network of interconnected

357
00:23:57,392 --> 00:24:01,216
neurons. And each one of those neurons is a fairly simple

358
00:24:01,248 --> 00:24:04,730
affair. Because it either fires or it doesn't

359
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,010
fire. It gives you the message on or off, yes or

360
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:08,630
no.

361
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,818
But what we call things, the plants,

362
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:17,338
birds, trees Are

363
00:24:17,394 --> 00:24:20,762
far more complicated than a neuron. And there

364
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:24,378
are billions of them, and they are all

365
00:24:24,434 --> 00:24:28,330
living together in a network. Just as there is an

366
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,670
interdependence of flowers and bees.

367
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,166
Where there are no flowers, there are no bees. And where there are no bees,

368
00:24:34,198 --> 00:24:36,970
there are no flowers. They're really one organism.

369
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:43,926
And so, in the same way, everything in nature depends

370
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:47,770
on everything else. So it's interconnected.

371
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,942
And so the many, many patterns of interconnections.

372
00:24:52,086 --> 00:24:55,014
Lock it all together into a unity. Which is, however,

373
00:24:55,182 --> 00:24:59,114
much too complicated for us to think. Think about. Except in very, very simple,

374
00:24:59,162 --> 00:25:00,270
crude ways.

375
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:08,122
But I am part of all this. I am,

376
00:25:08,146 --> 00:25:12,186
as it were, one of the cells in this tremendous brain. Which I can't

377
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:16,346
understand because the part cannot

378
00:25:16,378 --> 00:25:19,978
comprehend the whole. And yet.

379
00:25:20,114 --> 00:25:24,232
And yet, at the same time, I don't feel like

380
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:27,944
so many people seem to feel that I'm

381
00:25:28,072 --> 00:25:30,740
a foreigner or a stranger in this world.

382
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,472
Its aesthetic forms somehow appeal to

383
00:25:36,496 --> 00:25:40,184
me more than most of the aesthetic

384
00:25:40,232 --> 00:25:41,980
forms which men produce.

385
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,722
I feel in it as if in

386
00:25:48,746 --> 00:25:52,530
the same way, when you see a flower in a field, it's really

387
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:56,146
the whole field that is flowering. Because the flower couldn't

388
00:25:56,178 --> 00:25:59,634
exist in that particular place. Without the special surroundings of the

389
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:03,618
field that it has. You only find flowers in

390
00:26:03,674 --> 00:26:07,282
surroundings which will support them. So in

391
00:26:07,306 --> 00:26:10,802
the same way, you only find human beings on a planet of

392
00:26:10,826 --> 00:26:14,366
this kind. With an atmosphere of this kind, with temperature of this kind

393
00:26:14,538 --> 00:26:17,010
supplied by a convenient neighboring star.

394
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,206
And so, just as the flower is a flowering

395
00:26:23,238 --> 00:26:27,766
of the field, I feel myself as a personing,

396
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:32,410
a manning peopling of the whole universe.

397
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:39,382
In other words, I seem like everything else to

398
00:26:39,406 --> 00:26:43,870
be a center,

399
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:49,002
a sort of vortex at which the whole energy of

400
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:52,110
the universe realizes itself, comes alive.

401
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:56,682
A sort of aperture through which the whole universe is conscious of

402
00:26:56,706 --> 00:27:00,410
itself. In Other

403
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:04,190
words, I go with it as a center to a circumference.

404
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:09,288
You know, the astrologers, in theory at least, may not have been

405
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:12,632
so far wrong when in trying to draw

406
00:27:12,696 --> 00:27:16,264
a picture of a human mind or soul, they drew

407
00:27:16,312 --> 00:27:20,260
a very crude map of the whole universe centered on

408
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,696
the time and place of the birth of that particular person.

409
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:28,088
It's not a bad idea, but I don't think

410
00:27:28,144 --> 00:27:31,960
the astrologers know how to read their maps because the maps are too

411
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,532
crude. But the essential point is

412
00:27:35,556 --> 00:27:38,764
obviously that each one of us,

413
00:27:38,932 --> 00:27:42,640
not only human beings, but every leaf, every weed,

414
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,980
exists in the way it does only because everything else around it

415
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,652
does. In other words, there's a relationship between the

416
00:27:52,836 --> 00:27:56,156
center and the circumference, which is rather

417
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:58,960
like the relationship between the poles of a magnet.

418
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,424
Without the center, no circumference. Without the circumference,

419
00:28:03,552 --> 00:28:07,440
no center. And although we

420
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,184
say of poles that they're the poles

421
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,900
apart, that is to say, extremely different,

422
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,320
there's something between them. Just as the north and south poles of a magnet

423
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,554
are united by the magnet, so the individual

424
00:28:26,602 --> 00:28:29,390
and the universe are inseparable.

425
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:36,442
But the curious thing is that while that's rather easy to

426
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:40,090
see in theory, very few people are aware of

427
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:43,050
it in a. In an important,

428
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:47,150
strong way like one is aware of blue in blue sky

429
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,830
or of the heat in fire.

430
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,700
It's more of an idea than it is of a realization.

431
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,880
And so it strikes me more

432
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,456
and more that our failure

433
00:29:05,648 --> 00:29:09,520
to feel at home in

434
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,568
this astonishing brain in which we live is

435
00:29:13,624 --> 00:29:17,266
the result of

436
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:21,762
a basic initial

437
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:24,910
mistake in our thinking about the world,

438
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:31,330
and is in turn the cause of

439
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:35,150
what is beginning to look like the failure of our technology,

440
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,946
of the fact that everything we're doing to try to improve

441
00:29:41,018 --> 00:29:45,040
the world was a success in the short run,

442
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,800
made amazing initial improvements. But in the long run,

443
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,852
we seem to be destroying

444
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,388
the planet by our very efforts to control it and improve

445
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:59,732
it. And it strikes me

446
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:04,580
that that is because we are really too simple minded to

447
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,296
understand what we're doing. When we interfere with.

448
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:12,500
With the natural world strongly and on a vast scale,

449
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,592
we don't really interfere with it because that would suggest that we

450
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:18,700
were something different from it, something outside.

451
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,460
But I think what we're doing

452
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,720
is we are understanding it in

453
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,870
terms of languages,

454
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,138
numbers, in terms

455
00:30:40,194 --> 00:30:44,122
of a logic which

456
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:50,522
is too simple for the job, too crude for the job to

457
00:30:50,546 --> 00:30:51,430
begin with.

458
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,754
We understand everything in terms of words or numbers,

459
00:30:57,802 --> 00:31:00,350
and they're stretched out in rows, in lines,

460
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,380
and our eyes have to scan those lines in order to understand them.

461
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,152
But when I scan this view, I don't do

462
00:31:11,176 --> 00:31:13,820
it line by line by line.

463
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,300
I see the whole thing at once.

464
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,544
I take it in with, as it

465
00:31:22,552 --> 00:31:24,260
were, a wide angle lens.

466
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:31,830
But when I try to understand the world through literature

467
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:36,642
and through mathematics, I have to scan

468
00:31:36,706 --> 00:31:40,430
lines. You know, that's why it takes us so long to get educated in school,

469
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,658
because our eyes have to scan and

470
00:31:44,714 --> 00:31:48,642
organize miles and miles of print and

471
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:52,110
that takes us 20 years or more to get through it.

472
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,730
But life happens,

473
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,450
changes go on too rapidly for that.

474
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:05,250
Because you see in the world everything is happening all together, everywhere at once.

475
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:10,822
And meanwhile we with our myopic little minds are

476
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:14,246
working it out step by step because we are greatly assisted

477
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:16,170
by the rapidity of the computer.

478
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,540
But even so, the computer is still looking at

479
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:25,572
things in rows. As the magnetic tape goes through and is scanned by the computer,

480
00:32:25,636 --> 00:32:28,000
it's still all going along in a single track.

481
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:35,092
And I suppose then our difficulty is that we have lamentably

482
00:32:35,156 --> 00:32:40,260
one track minds in an

483
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,440
infinitely many track universe.

484
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:47,410
And we may have to come to the alarming conclusion

485
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,570
that the universe is smarter than we are.

486
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,930
I've just come back from Los Angeles.

487
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,742
I was down there to meet with a group of rather

488
00:33:01,806 --> 00:33:05,530
important people, people in the movie industry,

489
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,610
scientists and so on,

490
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,224
who were considering calling a

491
00:33:13,312 --> 00:33:16,952
congress of the best minds in the world to meet

492
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:21,320
in Los Angeles in the near future to

493
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,060
be a kind of planetary alarm conference.

494
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,660
They wanted scientists and statesmen,

495
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,352
religious leaders, and to

496
00:33:33,376 --> 00:33:36,994
do something to impress upon

497
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:41,090
the world through all the media that we

498
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,850
are in very serious danger of

499
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,050
destroying the biosphere, that is to say the whole

500
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:52,946
envelope of living creatures which covers this planet through pollution,

501
00:33:53,058 --> 00:33:55,858
overpopulation, nuclear fallout,

502
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,990
poisoning of our food and very lack of food.

503
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:04,092
And we met to discuss the problem of organizing this conference.

504
00:34:04,156 --> 00:34:08,252
And here were all these brilliant people and

505
00:34:08,276 --> 00:34:11,800
it came over us that we really didn't know what we ought to say.

506
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,092
I mean, you can scream and create a state of panic, but that won't do

507
00:34:16,116 --> 00:34:19,852
any good. And when

508
00:34:19,876 --> 00:34:23,516
it came down to it, we didn't know what we ought

509
00:34:23,548 --> 00:34:26,600
to say because we really don't know what to do.

510
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:31,898
Some things that we might do, for example to increase the food

511
00:34:31,954 --> 00:34:35,242
supply with high yield crops may be ecological

512
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:38,890
mistakes. And so

513
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:42,602
the consensus of almost everybody at the meeting was that in some

514
00:34:42,626 --> 00:34:46,138
way or other the human race has to learn how to leave

515
00:34:46,154 --> 00:34:50,922
the world alone and let what is called the natural homeostasis,

516
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:54,572
that is the self balancing process of nature, take care of the

517
00:34:54,596 --> 00:34:58,280
mess. Now, how are we going to do that.

518
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,284
This is Japanese ceremonial

519
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:12,200
tea. It's good on a cold day.

520
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,228
See, our problem is we don't really know how to stop. We've got something

521
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:22,802
stuck, started, and we see it's going in a wrong direction. And I

522
00:35:22,826 --> 00:35:26,590
think the difficulty is to borrow an old Chinese saying

523
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:31,490
that when the wrong man uses the right means, the right means work

524
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,882
in the wrong way. In other words, there's something wrong with the way we

525
00:35:34,906 --> 00:35:38,482
think. And while that is there, everything we do will

526
00:35:38,506 --> 00:35:41,670
be a mess. Now, what is it that's wrong?

527
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:49,480
Now, as far as I can see, the basic mistake is

528
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:54,524
that we've invented this wonderful system of language

529
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:58,540
and calculation and

530
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,964
that it is at once too simple

531
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:04,280
to deal with the complexity of the world.

532
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,308
And also, we are liable to confuse that system

533
00:36:09,364 --> 00:36:12,674
of symbols with the world itself, just as we confuse,

534
00:36:12,722 --> 00:36:16,274
say, money with wealth. A lot of people are in business to

535
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:19,394
make money instead of wealth. When they make the money, they don't know what to

536
00:36:19,402 --> 00:36:20,190
do with it.

537
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:30,610
And so, in the same way we confuse happiness

538
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,370
with status. And we confuse ourselves

539
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:37,144
as living organisms which are one with this whole universe.

540
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:40,240
Universe with something we call our personality.

541
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:46,284
Now, what is our personality? Our personality

542
00:36:46,332 --> 00:36:49,996
is what we call our image, our image of ourselves.

543
00:36:50,188 --> 00:36:53,612
And also our thought about ourselves, our idea of

544
00:36:53,636 --> 00:36:55,880
ourselves. This is the person,

545
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,076
in other words, what people meet and understand.

546
00:37:00,228 --> 00:37:03,668
And what I understand as Alan Watts is a big

547
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:07,040
act, which is not really me.

548
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,508
Because in the image of Alan Watts, there are not

549
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:15,268
all my unconscious processes, both psychological and physical.

550
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:18,740
The construction of my brain is not contained in the concept

551
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,964
Alan Watts. And the concept Alan Watts does not contain

552
00:37:23,092 --> 00:37:27,076
the inseparable relationships which I have with all the rest of the universe.

553
00:37:27,188 --> 00:37:29,850
And therefore, that concept is is a fraud.

554
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,374
And when it's mistaken for the real me, there's a confusion.

555
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:38,134
Because if somebody says to me, alan Watts,

556
00:37:38,182 --> 00:37:41,782
do something about it. The concept Alan Watts can't do

557
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:45,142
anything. In other words, because it's only a

558
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:48,614
concept, you can't make it lift

559
00:37:48,662 --> 00:37:52,054
a weight. Just as three is a concept. Three, the number.

560
00:37:52,142 --> 00:37:55,968
You can't make just plain three do anything. So also,

561
00:37:56,024 --> 00:38:00,000
you can't wrap up parcels with the equator. It's a useful imaginary line,

562
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,808
but it can't do anything. But we all

563
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:07,600
feel that this concept of ourselves, which we call our personality or

564
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,912
our ego, can do something because we think it

565
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:13,300
really exists. And I'll tell you why we think it exists.

566
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,600
What happens when you. If I were to say to you, now look

567
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,420
hard at the television screen, really look at it.

568
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,920
What do you do as distinct from just watching it in the ordinary way.

569
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,380
When you say, now I really got to see that, what do you do?

570
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,872
Notice that you tighten muscles all around here? That you frown

571
00:38:34,936 --> 00:38:38,472
a little, you clench your teeth, perhaps. Now,

572
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:41,180
what has that got to do with seeing anything clearly?

573
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,464
Absolutely nothing to do with it. Same thing when you Listen carefully.

574
00:38:45,512 --> 00:38:49,352
Now, listen carefully. Catch everything that's said, will you? Start tightening up

575
00:38:49,376 --> 00:38:53,180
around your ears. That has nothing to do with hearing clearly.

576
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,896
Now, from the moment we were little children, when teachers in class screamed

577
00:38:57,928 --> 00:39:01,900
at us, pay attention. We go tight in various ways.

578
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,936
Either to see or hear more clearly, to concentrate

579
00:39:07,048 --> 00:39:10,420
or to will something which is supposed to be difficult to do.

580
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:15,458
And that constitutes a habitual tension over the whole body that's

581
00:39:15,474 --> 00:39:19,234
there almost all the time. And that feeling of unnecessary

582
00:39:19,282 --> 00:39:23,026
tension is, as it were, the material sensation upon

583
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:26,898
which we fasten this concept of I. We hang

584
00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:30,450
it on to that feeling. The concept is

585
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:33,554
not us. The feeling of tension is completely

586
00:39:33,602 --> 00:39:37,590
phony. It has nothing to do with success in seeing, hearing or acting.

587
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,260
And so we get the marriage of an illusion with a falsehood.

588
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,640
And that we call ourselves. And no wonder we feel cut

589
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,740
off from everything, alienated, frightened of life and death.

590
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,740
So what has to happen is we have to come back

591
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:01,472
to a sane view

592
00:40:01,576 --> 00:40:05,340
of our own life. Which is

593
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,504
the way we really are. An organism functioning

594
00:40:09,552 --> 00:40:12,544
in terms of the whole environment, with the whole environment.

595
00:40:12,712 --> 00:40:16,304
Instead of this funny little separate personality. But how are we going to

596
00:40:16,312 --> 00:40:20,576
do that? People say, oh, you can't change human nature overnight.

597
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:24,288
You're asking us to give up the ego. And that's

598
00:40:24,304 --> 00:40:27,648
the most difficult of all things to do. Actually,

599
00:40:27,704 --> 00:40:31,310
it isn't, because the ego doesn't exist.

600
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,114
But of course, if you try to give up your ego with your ego,

601
00:40:35,242 --> 00:40:37,750
then it'll take you to the end of time.

602
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,554
Because this is the point. You can't transform

603
00:40:42,602 --> 00:40:46,330
yourself. You can't make yourself sane.

604
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,590
You can't make yourself loving. You can't make yourself unselfish.

605
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,400
And yet it's absolutely that necessary that we be that way.

606
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,320
It's absolutely necessary.

607
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,100
If we are going to hand over the

608
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:08,080
direction of nature to nature, which is what it comes to.

609
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,772
It's absolutely necessary that we let go of

610
00:41:12,796 --> 00:41:14,720
ourselves. And it can't be done.

611
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,028
Not by anything that we call doing it.

612
00:41:19,084 --> 00:41:22,916
Acting, willing, or even just accepting things. You can't

613
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:26,580
do it. Why? Because you don't really exist

614
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:30,804
as that kind of a separate ego or personality. It's just an idea

615
00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:34,532
based on a phony feeling. So when

616
00:41:34,556 --> 00:41:37,780
it comes down to It. It's shocking news for

617
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,380
us, for the human race, for our

618
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,470
pride. You're only making a mess by

619
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:48,830
trying to put things straight. You're trying to

620
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:51,970
straighten out a wiggly world, and no wonder you're in trouble.

621
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:58,050
So you can't do anything. So you can't transform yourself.

622
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:03,134
And what can you do? What happens then if you actually

623
00:42:03,222 --> 00:42:06,410
realize you've come to a dead end, what then?

624
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:12,020
What happens when you just wait? There's no nothing you can do.

625
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,728
You watch and all you see

626
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,900
is what goes on that is happening of itself.

627
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,900
You are breathing. The wind is blowing,

628
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,392
the trees are waving. Your blood is circulating,

629
00:42:28,536 --> 00:42:31,580
your nerves are tingling. It's all going on with itself.

630
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,620
But you know that's you. That's the real you,

631
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,310
the you that goes on of itself.

632
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,390
It's not the symbol,

633
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:46,978
it's not the person. It's you that's

634
00:42:46,994 --> 00:42:50,850
happening as when you breathe. Yes, you can get the feeling that

635
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:54,306
I am breathing by shoving your breath. But your breath goes

636
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:57,650
on day in and day out without you

637
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:00,770
doing anything about it or even thinking of it. The same way your brain is

638
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,680
functioning without your forehead. It.

639
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,244
So when you come to a dead end, and we are individually

640
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:11,560
and socially now in 1971,

641
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,560
at a dead end,

642
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,920
this is the moment of which it is said man's extremity is God's opportunity

643
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,080
because we have to stop, which includes

644
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:31,862
all this outside

645
00:43:31,966 --> 00:43:34,930
world no longer left outside.

646
00:43:52,920 --> 00:44:24,522
Sa I

647
00:44:24,546 --> 00:44:28,618
have a friend, a girl, who's very intelligent and articulate,

648
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:32,442
and she was born blind. And she

649
00:44:32,466 --> 00:44:35,270
hasn't the faintest idea what darkness is.

650
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:40,790
The word means as little to her as the word light.

651
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:46,602
So if you went to sleep,

652
00:44:46,746 --> 00:44:49,550
you're not aware of darkness when you're asleep.

653
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:55,070
And so if you went into sleep,

654
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,858
into unconsciousness for always and always and always,

655
00:44:58,914 --> 00:45:02,682
it wouldn't be at all like going into the dark. It wouldn't be

656
00:45:02,706 --> 00:45:04,590
at all like being buried alive.

657
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:11,504
It would be as if, as a matter of fact, you had never, never existed

658
00:45:11,552 --> 00:45:12,300
at all.

659
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,820
Not only you, but everything else as well.

660
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,900
You would be in that state as if you had never been.

661
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,952
And there, of course, there would be no problems. There would

662
00:45:29,976 --> 00:45:33,540
be no one to regret the loss of anything.

663
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,224
You couldn't even call it a tragedy because there would be no one to experience

664
00:45:38,312 --> 00:45:42,740
it as a tragedy. It would be simple,

665
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,160
nothing at all,

666
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:50,164
forever and for never.

667
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:52,880
Because not only would you have no future,

668
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,200
you would also have no past and no present.

669
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,132
Now, you would think that that was a point where we'd say, well, let's talk

670
00:46:04,156 --> 00:46:05,470
about something else.

671
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,266
But I'm not content with that.

672
00:46:10,338 --> 00:46:13,850
I demur because this makes

673
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:17,610
me think of two other things. This state

674
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,630
of nothingness makes me think first of all,

675
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:28,042
the. The only thing I. I get anywhere in my experience that's close to

676
00:46:28,066 --> 00:46:31,710
nothingness is the way my head looks to my eyes.

677
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:38,778
Because I seem to feel that there is a world out

678
00:46:38,834 --> 00:46:42,430
there as it were confronting my eyes.

679
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:47,434
And then behind my eyes there isn't

680
00:46:47,562 --> 00:46:51,434
a black spot, there isn't even a hazy

681
00:46:51,482 --> 00:46:55,030
spot. There's nothing at all.

682
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:59,476
I'm not aware of my head, as it were, as a black

683
00:46:59,548 --> 00:47:03,040
hole in the middle of all this luminous visual experience.

684
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:09,620
It doesn't even have very clear edges because the field of vision is

685
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,948
an oval. And if I run my fingers along

686
00:47:13,084 --> 00:47:16,404
my field of vision, it's like this. And this is

687
00:47:16,412 --> 00:47:20,440
the point where my fingers just disappear from sight. Vague edged.

688
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,992
But then behind the this oval of vision there

689
00:47:25,016 --> 00:47:28,432
is nothing at all. Just from the

690
00:47:28,456 --> 00:47:32,640
sense of sight. Of course, if I use my fingers and touch,

691
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,272
I can feel something behind my eyes. But if

692
00:47:36,296 --> 00:47:40,300
I use the sense of sight alone, there's just nothing there at all.

693
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,780
Now nevertheless,

694
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,640
out of that blankness I see.

695
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,292
Well, that's the first thing it makes me think of. Now the next thing it

696
00:47:57,316 --> 00:48:01,180
makes me think of is this. If when I'm dead

697
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,800
I am as if I never had been,

698
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,380
then that's the way I was before I was

699
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:12,140
born. Because just as if I try to go back

700
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,478
behind my eyes and find what is there, I can't to a blank.

701
00:48:15,574 --> 00:48:18,982
If I try to remember back and back and back and back,

702
00:48:19,086 --> 00:48:22,486
I've got my earliest memories. And then behind

703
00:48:22,558 --> 00:48:25,770
them, nothing. Total blank.

704
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:31,382
But just as I know there's something behind my eyes by using my fingers on

705
00:48:31,406 --> 00:48:35,170
my head, so I know through other sources of information

706
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:39,190
that before I was born there was something going on. There were my

707
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:43,060
father and my mother, mother and their fathers and mothers,

708
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,232
and the whole material environment of the earth and

709
00:48:47,256 --> 00:48:50,672
its life out of which they came. And behind that the

710
00:48:50,696 --> 00:48:53,860
solar system, and behind that the galaxy,

711
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,620
and behind that all the galaxies. And behind that

712
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,580
another blank space.

713
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:41,446
What seems to me to be lacking in our Western religious

714
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:45,610
observances is some sort of social ritual

715
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:49,890
which gives an opportunity for spiritual experience.

716
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:56,810
That is to say, for a transformation of the individual consciousness

717
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:01,420
so that in one way or another the individual is

718
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:05,532
able to realize his oneness with the

719
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:08,640
eternal energy behind this universe,

720
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:13,132
which some people call God and others prefer not to name

721
00:50:13,236 --> 00:50:16,796
or to conceive. So what I'm

722
00:50:16,828 --> 00:50:20,252
proposing Instead of the ordinary kind of religious service, is,

723
00:50:20,276 --> 00:50:23,120
as I said, a contemplative ritual.

724
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:28,092
The idea is not to have everybody shaken up and

725
00:50:28,116 --> 00:50:31,932
whooping around, but to bring

726
00:50:31,956 --> 00:50:34,400
about a state of profound peace.

727
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:40,204
So therefore, I should say something in a preliminary way about meditation,

728
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:43,320
or contemplation, as I prefer to call it.

729
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,996
Meditation is the act of allowing one's

730
00:50:48,028 --> 00:50:51,760
thoughts to cease, stopping the agitation of thinking.

731
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:57,942
Thinking is talking to yourself. Now, if I

732
00:50:57,966 --> 00:51:02,130
talk all the time, I don't hear what anyone else has to say.

733
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:07,170
Consequently, if I talk to myself all the time,

734
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:10,250
I don't have anything to think about except thoughts.

735
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:14,774
There is no interval between

736
00:51:14,862 --> 00:51:18,326
thoughts during which I can come into touch

737
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:22,490
with reality. That is to say, the world which thoughts represent

738
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:27,390
as words represent events or as money

739
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:31,582
represents wealth. And so if I'm never silent in

740
00:51:31,606 --> 00:51:34,846
my head, I'm living in a world of total abstraction,

741
00:51:35,038 --> 00:51:37,250
divorced from reality altogether.

742
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:41,278
Reality itself is neither mental nor spiritual,

743
00:51:41,374 --> 00:51:45,170
nor any concept that we can have of it. Reality is simply.

744
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,220
Now, therefore, to meditate. You might think that we attempt to suppress

745
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:59,396
thought. We do not do that because

746
00:51:59,468 --> 00:52:01,000
you cannot meditate.

747
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,684
Let me put that in a more emphatic way.

748
00:52:05,772 --> 00:52:07,400
You cannot meditate.

749
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:14,200
You, your ego image can only chatter,

750
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,240
because when it stops, it isn't there.

751
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,620
When you are not thinking, you have no ego, because your

752
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:27,172
ego is a concept. The thinker

753
00:52:27,236 --> 00:52:30,996
behind the thoughts, the feeler behind the feelings, and the thinker

754
00:52:31,028 --> 00:52:34,852
behind the thoughts is only a thought, an idea of some reference

755
00:52:34,916 --> 00:52:37,840
point to which all our experiences happen.

756
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:43,922
And that, of course, cuts us off from what we experience. It makes a

757
00:52:43,946 --> 00:52:47,314
great gap or gulf between the knower

758
00:52:47,442 --> 00:52:50,962
and the known. And that

759
00:52:50,986 --> 00:52:55,110
creates the spirit of alienation to the world from which we suffer.

760
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,470
Conflict, hate,

761
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:03,350
domineering, spirit arise from that basic division.

762
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:09,036
So when you come to an end of thought and you don't

763
00:53:09,068 --> 00:53:12,252
know how to meditate, you don't know what to do with your mind. Nobody can

764
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:16,012
tell you. Then thinking comes to an end naturally. You can

765
00:53:16,036 --> 00:53:20,220
begin meditation or meditation

766
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,852
happens. And that is happening is the

767
00:53:23,876 --> 00:53:26,680
watching simply of what is,

768
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:32,662
of all the information to you conveyed by your exterior

769
00:53:32,726 --> 00:53:36,262
and interior senses, and of the thoughts that

770
00:53:36,286 --> 00:53:39,750
keep chattering on about it all. You don't try to stop

771
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:44,130
those thoughts. You just let them run as if they were birds twittering outside.

772
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:48,886
And they will eventually get tired of themselves and stop.

773
00:53:49,038 --> 00:53:53,062
But don't worry about whether they do or don't. Just simply

774
00:53:53,206 --> 00:53:55,782
watch whatever it is that you are feeling,

775
00:53:55,846 --> 00:53:59,580
thinking, experiencing, and that's it. Watch it.

776
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:03,480
And don't go out of your way to put any names on it.

777
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,764
That's really what meditation is. And you see, you're not expecting

778
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:12,204
any result. You are in meditation, in an eternal

779
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:15,804
present. You are not doing it to improve

780
00:54:15,892 --> 00:54:19,532
yourself. You found you can't do that. Your ego can't possibly

781
00:54:19,596 --> 00:54:22,480
improve you because it's what's in need of improvement.

782
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:26,582
Your ego can't let go of itself because it is

783
00:54:26,606 --> 00:54:30,490
a complex called clinging to oneself. That's what it is by definition.

784
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:36,214
So it's just something that evaporates when

785
00:54:36,382 --> 00:54:41,062
it is understood that it is unable to achieve a

786
00:54:41,086 --> 00:54:44,454
transformation of consciousness, mystical experience,

787
00:54:44,622 --> 00:54:48,294
the vivid sense of union of individual

788
00:54:48,342 --> 00:54:49,370
and cosmos.

789
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:55,022
So one of the easiest ways to enter into the state of

790
00:54:55,046 --> 00:54:58,750
meditation is therefore listening to what

791
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:01,570
is using the sense of sound.

792
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:05,090
When you listen to sound,

793
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:09,982
you listen to it. Just the random sounds, you know, that are

794
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:12,730
going on in the room, in the street,

795
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:18,166
as if you were listening to music without

796
00:55:18,238 --> 00:55:21,410
trying to identify its source, name it,

797
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,590
or put any label on it at all. Just enjoy

798
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,890
whatever sound may be going on.

799
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:32,998
Just listen. Now, we can go on

800
00:55:33,134 --> 00:55:36,694
from that, listening to making

801
00:55:36,782 --> 00:55:40,758
sound ourselves and also listening to it. And instead of

802
00:55:40,814 --> 00:55:44,340
making sound, we learn the knack of letting it happen through us.

803
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,808
So then we get to what is in India called

804
00:55:50,864 --> 00:55:54,424
the use of mantra words,

805
00:55:54,552 --> 00:55:58,328
sounds chanted not for their meaning, but for their

806
00:55:58,384 --> 00:56:01,592
sound. And thus everything that

807
00:56:01,616 --> 00:56:04,920
will occur in the following celebration

808
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,290
will not be in the English language. It is

809
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:12,658
not intended to be understood in a discursive and intellectual sense.

810
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:15,830
You are asked only to dig the sound.

811
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:19,410
And I use the word dig advisedly because it means something

812
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:22,834
a little more than appreciate. It means enter into,

813
00:56:23,002 --> 00:56:26,482
penetrate, get right to the bottom of. Because when you

814
00:56:26,506 --> 00:56:29,970
are listening to sound and when you are letting sound hum through

815
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:33,352
you, this is one of the most obvious manifestations of the

816
00:56:33,376 --> 00:56:37,176
energy of the universe. And I suggest

817
00:56:37,248 --> 00:56:41,160
that churches get rid of their pews, where everybody is herded in like

818
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,500
cattle to look at the backs of each other's necks,

819
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,180
and that they spread their floor with rugs and cushions,

820
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,260
and that they have something in which people can approach

821
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,420
an ineffable, that means beyond words,

822
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,220
spiritual experience,

823
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:05,540
and not be told and forced

824
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,360
into a particular pattern of thinking of

825
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,832
mentation. So you see, for that reason,

826
00:57:12,936 --> 00:57:16,560
I have only given the slightest suggestion of how

827
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:20,320
one uses these mantra or the silence for

828
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,984
meditation. You all have your own way of doing things like that.

829
00:57:24,072 --> 00:57:28,010
Do it your own way. All this

830
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:32,570
is, is a vehicle, a support for

831
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:36,190
contemplation. Listen,

832
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:41,370
close your eyes, and go entirely into

833
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:43,150
a world of sound.

834
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:52,920
If I should say anything to you during this silence,

835
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:59,252
just listen to the sound of my voice and

836
00:57:59,276 --> 00:58:01,320
don't worry about the meaning of the words.

837
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:05,240
Your brain will take care of that by itself.

838
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:12,660
The air which is playing with your ears is

839
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,440
also playing with your lungs.

840
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:21,370
If you let your lungs breathe as they wish to

841
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,330
without helping them,

842
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,010
watch what they do.

843
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:36,170
When they feel like breathing out,

844
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,330
let it go out, but don't assist.

845
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,540
When it feels like coming in,

846
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,020
let it come in, but don't pull.

847
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,584
Are you breathing or is it breathing?

848
00:58:52,632 --> 00:59:00,856
You remember

849
00:59:01,048 --> 00:59:05,060
there is no special state you are supposed to be in.

850
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:11,842
Simply let yourself be aware of whatever state you

851
00:59:11,866 --> 00:59:14,270
are in. Don't name it,

852
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:16,750
just feel.

853
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:23,390
Now only is important.

854
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:39,676
Now, would you gently allow a

855
00:59:39,748 --> 00:59:43,612
sound to arise in your imagination in

856
00:59:43,636 --> 00:59:47,612
the ear of the mind? A sound that is pleasing to

857
00:59:47,636 --> 00:59:50,780
you and

858
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:56,668
which you would feel natural humming and

859
00:59:56,724 --> 01:00:00,942
letting your breath sort of fall out easily

860
01:00:01,006 --> 01:00:04,958
and naturally hum the sound

861
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:05,630
out loud.
